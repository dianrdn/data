Africa,"A very nice place, not just because of the many monkeys around that you can take pictures of but also a very nice forest with huge amazing trees and a lot of scenic places to take amazing photos.
The monkeys are playful and fun.
Thereâ€™s also a art gallery with amazing paintings you can even purchase."
Africa,"Good place to watch monkey playing naturally. Many stairs to go up and down.
Good experience and even better if you have kids
"
Africa,"The jungle like look from the start was there with extremely long trees, the only instruction lines were written and repeated multiple times within the park. There were plenty of attendants wandering in most locations to ensure safe encounters with the monkeys. Toilets were plentiful and clean. Worth doing once."
Africa,"The entrance was so beautiful.

The monkeys was funny and cute
But always running from you.

Don't stare at them and also don't feed them.

Have a nice trip."
Africa,"One of the coolest places in Bali and a one-of-a-kind experience! The monkeys are wandering around everywhere so be careful of your belongings because the little suckers do steal!

One of the staff helped me get a monkey to sit on my shoulder and it was the most amazing photo I've ever taken.

Even if you're a bit scared, please find the courage to go this place because you will truly regret it if you don't."
Africa,Itâ€™s a nice place. You can see many types of monkeys in their daily activities! The kids really loved the place :)
Africa,"Unique experience! The monkeys seems to be treated well. Be careful, they may snatch your bag or sunglasses. A must if you are in Ubud."
Africa,Really enjoyed this the monkeys are all living their lifes and you literally get a look in . And the occasional laugh when they try stealing your stuff
Africa,"Hundreds of monkeys frolic around you in the sanctuary. Beautiful forest, which is well looked after and cared for. It is certainly worth seeing when in Ubud."
Africa,Definitely a must go. Only 80k per person and is a very scenic walk through the monkey jungle! We really enjoyed the sanctuary and even had some monkeys jump onto our shoulders while walking. Don't forget to take shiny jewelry and glasses off. Try avoid a bag of any sorts. Enjoy the walk!
Africa,If you are into close encounters with monkeys this is your place. Was fun walking / spending some time around these funny and peculiar creatures. Watch out - they snatch.
Africa,"After waiting months to actually get to Bali on our 30th wedding anniversary celebration ... visiting the sacred Monkey Forest sanctuary was on my ""to do list"" ... because we are actively involved with primate rehabilitation in SA it was a definite place to be. Really amazing to walk between the primates in their ""own"" environment, although sad to see that although visitors are requested NOT to feed the animals, they still do. Still lovely. Grounds very clean and well kept, monkeys in good health. Enjoyed the visit."
Africa,"The monkeys was so fun and interactive, the staff is very friendly and helpful, wear comfortable shoes."
Africa,A must see for all travelers in Bali. From the second you walk in you can see monkeys. They are so well looked after and kept in their own habitat. Nelson the blind money is a must see. He is the only animal in a cage and it is because he is blind. Hold onto your bags and try not to drop anything those monkeys are fast. Cute to see
Africa,"We had not planned to visit Monkey Forest Sanctuary, but after walking past, we changed our minds and were so happy that we did. The monkeys do not bother visitors and the views and tranquility of the forest were amazing."
Africa,"Within Ubud - beautiful maintained sanctuary. Easy to walk around. The monkeys where all around. Be careful of having loose clothing, hats or packets of food - the monkeys will take these."
Africa,We had such fun watching the interactions with the monkeys that we spent 2 hours here. The lush surrounds and antics of the monkeys made for an enjoyable visit. It was well kept and the staff were helpful and friendly. Well worth a visit.
Africa,"We were taken to the Monkey Forest and paid 50 000 rupiah apart from the transport. There r no guides just guys following u around wanting to take pictures which u had to pay for.

The exit takes u through an informal market where the sellers bombard u to buy their goods. We took a shortcut to avoid them as it can become annoying.

The monkeys r not aggressive, they jump up on ur shoulder and actually sit long enough for u to take a photo, but because people feed them they associate people with food as well as plastic bags with food."
Africa,"Loved the experience and the peaceful day out. the Guides were helpful and the forest was very neat and well kept. The monkeys were well behaved and didn't harass us at all. Don't carry food or water as they may snatch it. Guides were all around monitoring, so it was most enjoyable! I was fascinated watching some monkeys trying to crack open nuts - Extremely clever and they have learned some amazing skills to open these nuts! Sat watching them for ages!"
Africa,"The forest is really big and beautiful, however itâ€™s really difficult to take nice photos as itâ€™s really busy. We went in the afternoon and there were a lot of other tourists. Would suggest going in the morning"
Africa,Spending half a day in this sanctuary is highly recommended. The gardens are superp with some interesting statues places all around. The monkeys are up to a lot a mischief and love to try and get into your bag. Very enjoyable.
Africa,"Lovely place to visit. Beautiful trees, plants and of course cute as ever monkeys. Lots of them. The monkeys are very happy just walking around you as you go along. We took around an hour to see everything. There were huge cages with sweet potatoes which are locked and fed to the monkeys when it is time. We even witnessed two monkeys diving (literally) into a trough at one the gates and swimming amongst the koi. They were just like people and were having the time of their lives."
Africa,"I couldâ€™ve given this a miss to be honest, but itâ€™s something you just have to do when visiting Ubud. Thousands of people and noisy, as itâ€™s surrounded by main roads. Didnâ€™t feel like a sanctuary at all."
Africa,"Very lovely walk in the middle of the forest and monkeys
I always enjoys
May you hidden place
Just have to be careful of the agressive monkeys"
Africa,Good place for them to run free and live their lives worth a visit to see them play in water and run around just dnt hide any food they will know !
Africa,"Our visit started off well, we read the rules and believed we were well prepared for our experience. We watched the keepers feeding a host of monkeys, big and small, very sweet and lots of photo opportunities.

Then we moved on to the conservation area, which was much quieter - we came round the corner to find a lone tourist being attacked by three or four monkeys, opening the zips and rifling through the contents of his backpack. Luckily a group of young Australians came round the corner and, between us, we managed to distract the monkeys so we could retrieve his belongings. In the process, the girl was badly scratched down her leg by one of the monkeys. Shaken, we decided to continue down the path. Suddenly we were surrounded by 5-6 large monkeys. Two of them grabbed my dress and tried to rip it, baring their teeth and hissing. We turned round slowly, trying not to provoke them any further but as we did, one jumped on my back, presumably to get into my backpack. Having seen what a monkey can do with its claws, I was very close to panicking, but my sister kept me calm and eventually it jumped off. We headed towards the nearest exit and passed a keeper, sitting on the steps (aren't they supposed to patrol to stop this kind of thing?), who was decidedly uninterested and just said visitors shouldn't provoke the monkeys.

If you stay in the busy areas, you may well have a wonderful time admiring the beautiful forest and the wildlife, but be warned if you stray into quieter areas."
Africa,"When in Bali The Monkey Forest is a must see.
This place is so beautiful and so relaxing very clean.
It has the most beautiful green forest around you best place for pictures.
The most beautiful monkey's around you they are very tame.
The koi fish is a must see.
It is worth every cent and only cost Rp 80.000."
Africa,This is a beautiful place with a lot of very happy monkeys! I did also enjoy the forest and found the whole experience to be very peaceful and fun.
Africa,"After seeing several temples and becoming bored of them, we came across the Monkey Sanctuary and were pleasantly surprised. The monkeys roam free and are very used to tourists, so continue their day like we don't exist (unless you have any sort of food packaging on you, they attempted to steal our wetwipes and babys pacifier), otherwise it's one of the nicer places to see monkeys. The forests and ponds are really beautiful and it's very peaceful, even though you're in the middle of the city. Definitely worth the money to get in and spend an hour or so.
Not really stroller / wheel chair friendly as it appears upon arrival. The top level has ramps, but getting to many parts like the amphitheater, exhibition hall and Holy water has many stairs which is inaccessible by wheel chair and requires carrying the stroller."
Africa,"I am not fond of monkeys, one tried to grab someones bag, so that was not pleasant. Just not for me."
Africa,"The monkeys at the Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary are well behaved, most of the time. They are the cutest thing you have have seen. I saw a family (Mom, Dad & two kids) , Dad looking for fleas on Mom and one kid playing close to Mom and Dad while the other snuggled up to Mom - It seemed like they had a white picket fenced house and the kids went to private school. I saw one monkey grabbing a water bottle from one of the tourists though and another being aggressive with another tourists - in defence of the Monkeys, some of the tourists get too close to them with their tripods and selfie sticks. I observed them from afar - as promised to my doctor - I will not get too close to any animal therefore no need for an injection for rabies. Unfortunatley on the day I went there was a study being done and some ""medical checks"" on some ot the monkeys so I could not see everything. Just outside the Sacred Forest though, after I had bought myself a Gelato Ice Cream and a Sarong - I met a Ghetto Monkey from the streets of Ubud - he came out of nowhere and grabbed the plastic bag with my sarong, unfortunately I could not let him have it - I had plans to go to the temple in the morning. The rascal went for my Ice Cream next and it was knocked off my grip and landed on the road, we both dived for it and the littel tosser got to it first ."
Africa,"Itâ€™s lovely seeing the monkeys roaming about freely, but be wary as they are quite naughty and will grab stuff"
Africa,"Not too far from Ubud central - you can easily walk.
Fee was 50k rp per person. Keep your tickets if you have a car or scooter for free parking.
Read the rules before entering and do follow them please.
Keep all valuable things like jewelry and sunglasses, hats in your bag. The monkeys are quite nifty at removing them and disappearing into the trees. They will also inspect visitors carrying bags and having pockets too.
They are fed by the rangers frequently.
If a monkey jumps on you, don't panic and decide to use your GoPro as a weapon. Keep moving until it loses interest - the babies and smaller monkeys are very playful and will most likely climb on you.
Enjoy the experience - they are entertaining to watch and you can easily spend an hour or more here."
Africa,"The monkeys were free and roaming around. The forest is nicely laid out with great pathways for visitors. Very warm, so make sure to put on light clothing. This was an awesome experience"
Africa,"The monkey forest sanctuary is so beautiful and well looked after. There are many gorgeous statues, temples and monuments within the sanctuary that will leave you in awe.

However, the monkeys are a little bit â€œover-friendlyâ€ and if youâ€™re carrying a handbag or backpack, chances are they will try to climb on you to have a look at whatâ€™s inside. This unfortunately happened to me while standing within close contact of a monkey who was sitting on a railing.

The money grabbed onto my sling bag and climbed on it, I didnâ€™t panic and tried to slowly move away from the railing and gently pull my bag with me, the monkey however, didnâ€™t quite like this idea and instead of nicely climbing off, he decided to bite me on the hip.

If this happens to you and your skin is Pierced or blood is drawn, you will need to get a rabies vaccine as well as the rabies immunoglobulin and tetanus shots (for me this included the vaccine and immunoglobulin for tetanus). They also give you herpes B medication and antibiotics. This is really not a pleasant experience as you have to have the rabies shots on day 1,3,7,14 & 28. They also were going to charge us 600 000 000 rupiah for the rabies immunoglobulin so we ended up flying home early so that I could get the shot.

The sanctuary is beautiful and so are the monkeys but please do be careful and rather donâ€™t get too close."
Africa,"This was a super cool experience! The monkey forest is a beautiful place, filled with greenery, old traditional structures and of course monkeys! You will find monkeys in every corner of the forest - they are super cute, interesting and intelligent. Be careful with your belongings, your sunglasses, cell phones, wallets. They're super clever, so they can unzip bags, pockets, you name it. All in all it is an incredible place to visit when you are in Bali, it was on the top of our list!"
Africa,"Beautiful scenery, reminded me of Indiana Jones movies. Good to see the monkeys in thier habitat. Visit in the morning before it gets too hot."
Africa,Top tip - go early. Itâ€™s less busy and less hot. Yes itâ€™s lovely to watch the the monkeysâ€™ monkey around- but the highlight for us was the walkway down past the massive tree to the Holy spring temple and being able to sit quietly at the pool for a short while.
Africa,Best best best! I just loved and appreciated this experience. The monkeys in a beautiful natural setting. They could get cheeky but itâ€™s suggested to just witness them in their surroundings. I was fortunate that I sat down and watched the monkeys being fed (9am) and one decided to jump on me! It was so sweet! We are not allowed to feed them ourselves anymore FYI (in the past you could buy bananas to feed them). I recommend go as it opens! The crowd gets crazy busy and overwhelming and thatâ€™s when the monkeys get super cheeky .. enjoy!
Africa,A very beautiful place to visit in Bali. One of the popular tourist attractions. I really enjoyed it. Just got to be careful with your bag as the monkeys associate this with food so they try to snatch it away from you. So best is not to carry anything when visiting the money sanctuary. Other than that. It's beautiful.
Africa,"People can be real ignorant. There are warnings signs s d guides to tell you what mot to do but as stupid as some people are just to get attention they don't follow the rules and get hurt.
Read the signs listen and follow...animals are unpredictable and can be aggressive if provoked....
The forest itself is beautiful green and lush. However I was here 2 years ago and it was greener...understanding though as the forest has not seen rain in 6 months. I pray it does and gets back its lush"
Africa,"Its such a great experience to see how the culture, religion and respect or animals all combine in one place"
Africa,Went during the midday heat and wasnâ€™t disappointed! Covered in shade and kept on our toes by all the fascinating monkeys and their behaviors. A bit pricey (80000Kpp) but enjoyed it. A classic Ubud experience!
Africa,"Really enjoyed our time here. As long as you don't get too close to the monkeys, they're quite fine. They are comfortable among people, and not camera shy at all haha. A must visit when in Ubud"
Africa,"A must see for any Bali visitor. Peaceful walks through a stunning forest, and of course, monkeys everywhere. Clean well looked after sanctuary. I donâ€™t recommend taking drinks or food with you, the monkeys have a way of taking it out of you bag or will take it from your hands."
Africa,The monkeys are so cute and naughty and it was truly a blessed experience to get so up close and personal with them. And the cultural sites inside the forest were unbelievable.
Africa,"Perhaps I am subjective, but coming from Africa, this is not special at all. It is just a sanctuary for a number of monkeys and the monkeys do what monkeys do. They try to steal food, the react aggressively if they can not get hold of the food and they act monkey-like. That's that."
Africa,"I nice space where the monkeys are free and come and go as they please

We entered a bit late but there are nice walking trails and experience the ""jungle"""
Africa,On entry the monkeys were super cheeky. When they say remove all extras they really mean it. The first one jumped on us dug in my bag ...with no food and stole some wipes as the bag was quite empty. The next one tried to pick pocket my camera. Around the next corner and for the rest of walk they were ever so cute and entertaining. The gardens are beautiful and feel like a jungle. We really enjoyed the experience. Babies in prams not a good idea as the monkeys will jump on them. Rather carry small people
Africa,"Our driver, Gusti from Loka Bali Tours, took us to the Monkey Forest as this is a MUST when you travel to Bali! You literally feel like a tiny ant while walking through this magical forest!! We were even so lucky to have a few monkeys give us some love ;-)"
Africa,"We had a fantastic morning at the Monkey Forest, it is huge and we had loads of fun wandering about and finding monkeys! The forest is really clean and well looked after and there are lots of assistants around keeping an eye on the monkeys. There are some VERY clear rules on signs throughout the forest in all languages and the only issues we saw where monkeys jumped on people were those who didn't stick to these rules (i.e no open food). A really great day out for all the family!"
Africa,"The area is big and quite a walk... fun to watch them and the way they behave while eating, playing, fighting with each other etc but need to be careful as sometimes they become violent. Follow the rules on the notice board and act smart."
Asia,The park itself is green and very pleasing. There is a lot of monkeys and they are very friendly. It is good place to hide from hot sun and to have some walk. To me the wild monkeys nex to Uluwatu temple were more entertaining (but very aggressive too)))
Asia,Donâ€™t make noise and donâ€™t look at them in their eye .. but better to go without kids as they are in predictable
Asia,It was nice day after breakfast we visit monky forest by walking as near our hotel anumana hotel many monkies even they are walking outside street and funny
Asia,"Spending quality time with my children and my mom roaming around Bali, we end up that place.

Nothing really special to see in that place but the bonding and fun that it brought to my family was what that counts.
My daughter's alcohol spray was picked pocketed by a monkey....yes, literally. And that experienced can never be bought.

To those who wants to visit that place?
Be careful with your belongings and don't panic if the monkey will come to you.

"
Asia,"We spent a lovely day at this place. Although, I wouldn't recommend this to my friends or family. Instead of walking around the forest looking at monkeys, I would rather spend the time elsewhere."
Asia,Were here with some friends and it was soo cool to se so many wild monkeys. The forest was quite big and it was very nice walking around there.
Asia,"although you are in a forest, there are too many concrete paths to make you feel like in a real forest.
monkeys roam freely and can thus grab your bag or something.
if you have never seen monkeys, go to a zoo instead of here, exc. if you're staying in ubud or nearby"
Asia,Even David Attenborough went for Zoo quest for a dragon in the 1959!! AMAZING!! a lovely stroll in a small forest full of ancient sculptures and wonderful lively monkeys!! Some people are scared to go but don't you be! No visit to Ubud is complete without a visit to the sacred monkey forest!
Asia,"Magic place,must have to see!
Just be careful with your backpacks!
Feeding is not allowed. Suddenly monkey can be aggressive, donâ€™t relaxðŸ˜‰"
Asia,"I was initially a bit cautious about the visit, but was won over by the experience. Just follow the rules posted and enjoy the monkeys. There are lots of staff about to monitor the activity. We spent nearly two hours there."
Asia,This was a really good hour or two experience with monkeys everywhere amongst the green understory of the beautiful forest.
Asia,"So entertaining!! Careful not to bring bags or food, as the monkeys are very clever and unzip things very quickly. I loved it!!"
Asia,"Been to this place before and it still amazes me,monkeys are everywhere so the they always advise the tourist that do not bring and food,water bottles/plastic that easy to grab,some they advise not to wear sunglasses and any accessories that hangs and give attentions to the monkeys to prevent them from stealing it.
Thereâ€™s a water stream if you go further inside it and youâ€™ll pass this huge beautiful old banyan tree under that is a bridge with snake sculptures.
"
Asia,"I read many reviews before going there and went prepared to not atract much ""monkey attention"". It is possible to have a fun experience when you respect their space and don't panic. The more inwards you walk, the more monkeys you start to spot, engaging in all sorts of activities. Watch out for monkey poo as well! haha

The place could have more information on the monkeys and also use the area to raise awareness towards animal welfare and preservation."
Asia,This was a really great experience. Many close encounters with the monkeys. It is an awesome activity to do in the day time as it is a lovely walk through the forest. The monkeys sure know how to put on a show for visitors. Great day out.
Asia,I visited Monkey Forest with a friend and we really enjoyed walking around and watching the monkeys. It was easy to find and quick to enter. We spent a few hours watching the monkeys. They were very accustomed to having people around them but looked free to do as they pleased in the forest. Staff were on hand to keep an eye on the monkeys. Facilities were clean and we were able to take our time walking round
Asia,A great stroll through this site will provide plenty of entertainment watching the monkeys try to take anything they can from the tourists!
Asia,"Monkeys are in very good conditions and have plenty of free nature to play around. It is great to see a park like this where the animals are not just put into cages.
However the visitors are still sometimes pretty careless and will bring plastic bags etc into the forest even there are plenty of signs showing what to bring and what not.
"
Asia,"To drive more than an hour just to see the monkeys, itâ€™s honestly quite disappointing. No show except for a feeding session. No doubt the younger kids are quite trolled by it all but have a go only if you have spare time on hand in Bali."
Asia,"I donâ€™t normally visit animal attractions, but the monkeys here seemed happy and well looked after. There is a fence around the sanctuary, but the monkeys are able to get over it easily and do their own thing. They are fed three times a day and there are vets caring for them. Visitors are told not to interact with the monkeys, but the monkeys have other ideas! Had a couple sitting on my head. They will try to steal everything you have (including the earrings out your ears), so prepare for this. Enjoyed hanging out with the monkeys."
Asia,"It is what it says on the tin. Monkeys roaming freely and being monkeys. They stole my tissues - climbed onto my shoulder, opened my bagpack and took the only thing inside. On that note, if the Monkey wants its way, you just let it be. I stood still, motionless and didn't antagonise, partly because I knew there was nothing in there. Nevertheless, it was the highlight of my experience.

What I really liked about the sanctuary is that it is for the Monkeys. I much prefer these places to zoos. Though having experienced the cheeky monkeys in south Vietnam, I preferred it there. You could feed them food provided by the organisers, but not here."
Asia,"This is one of the activities you can take staying in Ubud, if you are not up to travel far. The monkey forest features a calm picturesque surroundings with beautiful stone carvings at the entrance. Better to visit first thing in the morning to avoid mobs and keep cool before the heat. Monkeys do not pay you much mind, unless you really provoke them. The entrance fee is 50K IDR & free parking with the entrance ticket."
Asia,"Me and my mom had a limited time in the sanctuary from 17:20 and left just before it closes at 18:00. The monkeys are everywhere. The place itself is beautiful and Yes, Iâ€™d recommend the place but keep your belongings secured. Maybe an hour visit is ample to explore the location."
Asia,"We loved the monkey sanctuary. It was fascinating to watch them roam, feed and in some cases cause mayhem!

My daughter loved it. The grounds are well kept and we saw several feeding sessions. No cages? Just a huge forest.

One tip- keep your water bottle out of sight. If they see it they will have it!!!"
Asia,"We left early in the morning to beat the sun, and the forest was beautiful! Macaques were everywhere and we never had a problem with them stealing anything, even though I had read it could be a problem. The monkeys were docile and friendly. I even saw a Komodo Dragon lurking in the woods, which was amazing at the time, but in hindsight was actually pretty dangerous... FYI my hotel staff didn't believe me that I saw one lurking freely in the bushes until I showed them the photo I took, and they confirmed it was indeed a Komodo."
Asia,"Great place to see lots of monkeys that dont try to steal your things! Was taking a photo and a little guy jumped on me and its girl/boyfriend got jealous and bite my arm and slapped me. Solid two piece, He was a Mike Tyson fan for sure! I wont go back... Hahah. But you should go!"
Asia,"We went there afternoon and it was only 1 hour to close but we enjoyed it so much,, we found monkeys are very friendly and they donâ€™t attack you until you bother them,,,, I recommended so much!!!!
"
Asia,"I've been to the Monkey Forest for the first time few years ago when you used to be buy and feed bananas to the monkeys. This is no longer allowed, but the monkeys were programmed for that. They are smart and constantly looking for easy food, so do not bring water bottles or snacks with you. They will smell, run to grab it and be taken away. Keep all loosen items like hats, sunglasses, save. Be careful with mobiles as well. They can easily grab anything that the have interested on and run away. After that, forget it, you will never get it back. Kids holding food and distracted tourists are easy target and harassed all the time. Nothing to be worried about own safety, but be ready to have monkeys jumping on you and be cool about it. :)
It is one of the must go places in Bali."
Asia,"Harbored fears of aggressive monkeys in a tourist trap, turned out to be an unexpectedly nice experience. Nice environment with lots of carvings etc, but the stars of the show were of course the monkeys. Did not observe any aggressive behavior as long as one observe common sense guidelines. Did see lot of cute behavior by some of the monkeys. Lots of tourists so yes it was a bit too crowded, but the monkeys apparently were quite used to all this."
Asia,"Everyone who is staying in Ubud has to pay a visit in Monkey Forest! A well organized place, clean and with helpful staff so you can enjoy your encounter with the lovely monkeys at their true environment! We didnâ€™t have any problems with the monkeys but pay attention to the written directions upon entering the park"
Asia,"Monkeys everywhere! #$$^Ã·%Ã·â‚¬Ã·Â£

Something unique and different with a lot of monkeys !

Saw a monkey jump a guys neck for fun, a little too friendly, but you have to be careful not to agitate them"
Asia,Been there 3 times already and amazes me every time I visit. Definitely go visit these monkeys in their home
Asia,"Maybe for now this is our best time!!! We know that they are aggressive and dangerous sometimes, but those monkeys are so funny and cute
"
Asia,"A place when you can actually enjoy watching monkeys in their natural habitat!!
Very fun for kids also"
Asia,"This place is very nice, the views are great, bog trees nice walks and monkeys, monkeys everywhere. Be aware of whatever you are having in your hands, they like to steal you the food and even the bags. They are not agressive and can take selfies with them. Entrace fee is 80 000 Rp"
Asia,Sacred monkey forest in bali is one of the best forest and interesting in bali .wow what a majestic it was.great nature gift it was
Asia,"Monkey Forest Ubud, also known as Mandala Suci Wenara Wana (locally known) is the sanctuary and natural habitat of the Balinese long-tailed Monkey. It is located at Padangtegal Ubud, Bali. About 749 monkeys live in this sanctuary.

The Monkey Forest is owned by the village of Padangtegal and village members serve on the Monkey Forest's governing council"
Asia,"It is a one time visit place. There are lots of monkeys around, so u need to be careful and follow the guidelines suggested or else you might get bitten by the monkeys, we witnessed one person getting bitten. The small monkeys look very adorable, itâ€™s fun to watch them all play."
Asia,"Must do , especially with children
Lovely friendly playful monkeys
Very safe
Beautiful trees
Great to walk around and interact with the critters
ðŸ˜Š"
Asia,"monkeys every where. walking over water flow side is good.
You can have photos with monkeys. my kids loved it"
Asia,"You can't come to Ubud and miss seeing this beautiful sanctuary. It can be easily covered in less than 2 hours. Quite frankly, it's amazing to see the monkies patiently tolerating us in their natural habitat !!"
Asia,"Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary is a must visit when in Ubud. Very well maintained, you will get to see Monkeys in their a forest like creation."
Asia,"* Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary ðŸ’
Read the rules on the board when you buy the tickets ðŸŽ«. (Donâ€™t look in the eyes of monkey ðŸµ)
This place is full of monkeys ...shady greens all around with historical huge trees with all long spread roots ..and flowing water by the side as you move deep inside.
A perfect place to take pictures but be careful about your belongings and cameras ðŸ“¸ as you never know maybe a monkey ðŸ’ is keeping an eye on you .ðŸ˜… hehe

Do experience this place.

#Finishyourplatefirst #musaafir_mehra"
Asia,"80,000 rupiah for just watching wild monkeys.Tourist trap, waste of money and really disappointing. I went there for its rating, but I was shocked , there was nothing. If you want to see wild monkeys, with not much security, this may be your place. Too crowded, I did not know what else to do. You can just roam about inside for like 15-20mins, click pictures of monkeys and you are done. One can watch monkeys playing with plastic bottles, grabbing people's bags and even bite some tourists. No medical aid nearby as such. You can watch monkeys free of cost anywhere in Bali. I think visit to this place should be made free of cost!!"
Asia,Monkey forest of Ubud is one of the key attraction in Bali. There are 2 such forest And this one is bigger and better.
Asia,This place has lots and lots of monkeys with all sizes. Looks like most of then are very friendly. Kids will enjoy more.
Asia,"One of the good spots to include in your itierinary. Its clean and very well maintained. The forest also has innumerable moss covered stone carved statues and a temple. The monkeys are cool and are on their own.
The walk through the nature is one of the best and you will love it .There is a bridge with aerial roots which looks good."
Asia,"Monkey forest is, of course, filled with monkeys! It's fun to watch these naughty creatures go around doing their monkey business. It's a pleasant surprise to find a jungle like this in the middle of town! Peaceful, calm and a relaxing place is how one can best describe this. Beware of your belongings, specially if you have something in a paper bag or plastic bag. The monkeys WILL try to grab it.
"
Asia,"Ubud monkey forest is a very good sanctuary, If you want to enjoy forest then you should have 4 hour at least otherwise you can cover it within 2 hr, this is around 2 KM long but generally traveler goes 500-600 Miter , there is staff also there they feed monkeys, do not try to feed monkeys. and spatially Banana."
Asia,"This is a must visit place for anyone going to Ubud. Not just because of the funny creatures, but because of the amazing vegetation you will find in this place!
Amazing trees and beautiful grounds will captivate adults, while the monkeys will give quite a bit of chuckles and scares for the younger ones!"
Asia,"Spent a few hours walking through this forest on well laid out trails enjoying the monkeys who were well fed and kept. With basic precautions, you will love the walks.

As expected, the simians know what to grab if given the chance so follow instructions of the forest keepers.

I did see some people trying to get much too close to the monkeys and I thought that was much too much - who would like a camera or phone in ones face ?"
Asia,"I had read a number of reviews and seen videos of peopleâ€™s experiences in Monkey Forest. I dressed accordingly. Jeans, shirt and shoes. No sunglasses or backpack. Nothing in hand. The tour takes a max of 2 hrs if you also want to sit and enjoy the antics of the monkeys. The monkeys did not bother me and often a monkey or two walked by close to me. I did see monkeys landing on shoulders which had backpacks and trying to unzip looking for food. If such things scare you do not carry anything that can attract a monkey. One monkey bit a girl who went too close. It tried to grab her phone. She wouldnâ€™t let go and the monkey bit her under arm. Then I saw a tug of war between a young man and a monkey over a bottle of water. Luckily the monkey gave up after some time. I even saw a monkey running away with a plastic bottle. We have no business handling plastic carelessly. Being a solo traveller I made sure I followed them well. I had a wonderful time in there. In fact the first place I visited in Ubud. Do not wear loose skirts or leave your long hair open as the small monkeys love to latch on to them. I saw this happen. Dress sensibly and you should be fine!"
Asia,"Long trip to travel to this place, for us from India it was nothing special, view though is good, Did not wait for the dance as we would have reached back to the hotel after 9.00 pm"
Asia,Good place to visit but there are limited varieties of monkeys. The show is also below average. Kids will enjoy well.
Asia,"This is on the way to a few attractions and is a must visit if you have family around, specially kids. The monkeys are not aggressive which makes it even better."
Asia,It is a beautiful place with natural and scenic beauty. It consists of ancient architectural monuments and temples. Also you get to see a lot of monkeys along the way. You can feed them and click pictures with them if you wish to. Great place to visit.
Asia,"Good light treck in the humid environment. The park seem to have been made in a area which was inhabited with monkeys and thus the monkeys are in peace.
Don't disturb them unless you want to be hasseled."
Asia,I will never tire of saying that Bali is endowed with so much natural beauty that one can actually forget what a concrete construction looks like! The people too live in such perfect harmony with plants and animals that the ecosystem seems complete and perfect! Me on the other hand yells at the sight of a mere lizard! ouch!
Asia,"This is a very unique place - a natural habitat of monkeys and it feels that we are literally living in their environment.

Slightly scary as the monkeys are smart enough to snatch stuff from pockets and bags.

Nothing else to see inside . Can visit once if in Ubud with kids.

"
Asia,Very well maintained small forest. Lots of monkeys in natural habitat. One enjoys the walk in the park.
Asia,"We entered after paying a hefty fees of 80,000 IDR and it was nothing but a disappointment. There is no guide support and neither any audio guide. You can just walk aimlessly seeing the same monkeys numerous times.

Most of the temples were found closed and on is not informed of that at ticket/information counter."
Asia,"Well this place although commercialised for tourists offers a very close contact with the monkeys which count this place as their natural habitat. Also, this seems to be avery old and well preserved sanctuary with lot of greenery and trees. There are Monkeys (Macaques) all around and they're not at all violent. They even play with the tourists whom they like. And sometimes they even frown at some if they don't like them.
Outside food, plastic bottles and poly bags are not allowed inside the forest area and also visitors are not allowed to feed the monkeys with outside food stuffs like biscuits, cookies or bread etc.
Entry Ticket costs 80K IDR/ person for adults and 60K IDR/ Person for children below 12.
Timings : 8:30 AM to 05:30 PM and forest area closes by 6 PM. Last entry ticket you can buy is until 05:30 PM.
Huge Parking area (Paid Parking) is just outside the entrance.
There are lot of security guards throughout the forest area who are really helpful in case you need assistance.
Also, there are lot of clean rest rooms (wash rooms) inside the sanctuary.
Ubud local street market is just outside through the exit gates 2 and 3.
There are also lot of good restaurants, pubs, spa and massage centres around the monkey forest."
Asia,"Monkey forest of Bali is a must visit place to enjoy the natural habitat . And , the monkeys are very friendly but they can snatch your camera or your sunglasses, you must aware about this thing.
"
Asia,"-> Good place to visit and enjoy with Lots and lots of monkeys...full of greenery and water bodies in the Sanctuary.
-> 2-3 hours is the maximum time you need to visit this place.
->Entrance ticket 80K IDR per person"
Asia,"Its a very different kind of experience. Monkeys roaming freely, greenery, trees and walkways make it a treat. Absolutely, amazing experience."
Asia,Tropical rain forest - well preserved and maintained - not very far from our hotel . It was worth visiting the forest while in Ubud
Asia,"We were a bit weary about visiting due to people talking about getting bitten, aggressive monkeys etc but once in Ubud we decided to go anyway as we didnâ€™t want to miss out. We went late afternoon as weâ€™d heard this was when the monkeys are more calm as theyâ€™ve been fed all day and overall, it was a fantastic experience. The monkeys were good fun.

However, common sense must prevail. First of all, you are in their habitat so youâ€™ve got to know that and respect it when you visit - theyâ€™re wild animals.

If you stand about holding things in your hand, thereâ€™s a good chance a monkey will swoop and grab it off you, so just donâ€™t risk it. One woman left a packet of Panadol on top of her bag and low and behold, a monkey grabbed it and made off into the tree before eating every tablet in the packet - said women proceeds to scream at the monkey as if it should have known better than to steal her Panadol ðŸ¤·ðŸ»â€â™‚ï¸

We also saw a girl sitting on a wall beside about 5 monkeys trying desperately to get a â€˜selfieâ€™ with them with one on her shoulder. She got the photo, then the monkey proceeded to climb on her head and scratch her by trying to hold on as she tried to get it off - Iâ€™m not sure what she expected would happen.

Moral of the story, be sensible, remember theyâ€™re wild animals and be cautious, then just enjoy the experience for what it is.

#MonkeyForest
#Day2

Monkey forest as the name suggests is a forest area with lots and lots of monkeys around. It is spread accross 12.5 hectares of forest with around 700 monkeys. It is located at padangtegal, Ubud. You would also be delighted to see more than 186 species of trees which ofcource will be a treat to your lungs due to abundance of fresh air around. Opening hours are from 8.30 am to 6 pm and the ticketing counter closes half an hour before the closing hour. The ticket would cost you 50000 in Bali currency which is equal to around 200-250 INR depending on the dollar value.

Some precautions are important before you start exploring this place. Carry minimal stuff with you as your focus once you enter would definitely be on monkeys.You would not even come to know when their focus is on you too :) Anything flashy should definetely be avoided and left in the car itself.If any of your stuff is taken by any monkey ,let it go. You would not even come to know when their would be dozens of monkey around you . Ensure that you don't carry any food to feed the monkeys. Don't do any eye contact and just explore the place calmly."
Asia,"Monkeys and monkeys everywhere. A sight to behold. Some upto mischief while some busy eating. Some playing games with onlookers, while others goofing around. The stream flowing across the forest adds to the magic. Absolutely worth the ticket money."
Asia,please take some time out and do visit this amazing sanctuary you will love every bit of this place I would personally recommend it to each and everyone
Asia,"The Monkey Forest in Bali is home to some 800 plus Monkeys of different age groups. They live in a huge forest and are well taken care of by the local authorities and caretakers. They are well fed and their job is to jump and entertain the crowds. The monkey forest is a nice place to spend a few hours especially if you have kids, however, keep in mind to follow the rules. Some monkeys are known to snatch sunglasses and caps etc."
Asia,Monkey Forest in Ubud is very beautiful. It would take upto 2 hours to walk around and explore the place. Monkeys are well behaved until you show them food or tease them. They are well fed as you can see corn and stuff at dedicated spots for them to sit and eat.. We encountered a few monkeys who did not shy away.. they were happy to pose with you in a photo..
Asia,"This was the first place our guide took us on our day trip to ubud and Tanha lot. First itâ€™s not just the monkeys, one can visit this place for a unique jungle walk. There are a lot of monkeys which sometimes trouble the visitors but there are staff persons at every corner who can handle the monkeys. There are several temples inside the park .However like many other Balinese temples the entry is restricted. The entry fess is 50000 IDR.
Good to visit in early hours to avoid noon sun."
Asia,"Beautiful temple and forest in the town centre of Ubud, there is even a stream and a gorge! A must do in Ubud."
Asia,"This is one place which was really talked about in Ubud and that one place which i did not want to visit. Since my family and friends were keen , we ended up going yo Monkey forest. I was pretty and green and the monkeys were not really troubling others. my little one quite enjoyed watching them."
Asia,Monkey forest is worth a visit if you are in ubud. The sanctuary is very well maintained and clean. Dont keep any kind of food with you as monkeys will try to steal it and can get aggressive. There are plenty of staff to make sure the guest are safe. It's a beautiful walk through the forest. We Spend almost 2 hours inside the forest.
Asia,"If you like wildlife specially monkeys, feeding them and nice big banyan trees and cool surroundings this is a good place There is an open hop on hop off bus picking people from the different hotels too"
Asia,"Worth a visit but almost feels like a tourist trap, especially if you're from Asia where these monkeys are not a rarity at all. Go for the temples within the compound, the nice stream and the feel of the shaded grove with these monkeys. Do not carry food or plastic bottles, otherwise the monkeys won't spare you."
Asia,worth a visit if you are in Ubud or if you love animals. monkeys are well trained and dont bother you unless you bother them
Asia,"Abode to the hordes of monkeys, it's not that quiet walk. Monkeys are harmless if you don't bother them. Do not carry anything that catches their attention namely food, wide hats, shiny ornaments etc. Do not startle them. Do not try to pet them. Don't go near a mother with baby. I saw two tourists getting roughed up by the monkeys and they went straight to the hospital inside the monkey forest. Some tourists have their objects taken away from them. The caretakers inside the forest are helpful (and they would click a picture of you with the monkeys). There is a temple inside and if one is lucky, one can see localites performing and showcasing their vivid culture.

P.S: Don't be discouraged by so many reviews like mine, that beware oneself of monkeys. They are perfectly harmless and inquisitive primates; and thousands of tourists visit the forest every day with nothing happening to them. As you can see in the end every reviewer including me were allowed to write their reviews by the monkeys."
Asia,The monkey forest in Ubud has nothing much to boast of other than the beauty of the forest and the regular monkeys that come to forage into human territory. For those who haven't seen these primates before it's thrilling otherwise nothing special other than the only attraction wing that you get to see and handle tamed hats and python which you can take fotos with for a price ie. 100000indo rupuah if u handle both. You can take fotos as well and being able to do that is a one off experience. Otherwise nothing much to report as the entry within the temple inside is restricted to foreigners.
Asia,Here they have kept 8 different species of monkies. They are well fed hence they are not aggressive. You can take a round of it within 10 minutes if it doesn't interest you.
Asia,"A lovely large area to see gray long tailed monkeys in their most bawse-like habitat. However, nearly got bit by an infant who wanted the sunglasses perched on my head. Fortunately I was able to shake him off without screaming bloody murder, but it did leave me a bit unsettled."
Asia,The place is a must visit as it brings you close to the nature and also you get to experience the funny side of monkeys :)
Asia,This is a nice place to see lot of monkeys in their natural habitat. The sanctuary has been well preserved in its natural condition. There are lot of monkeys and they do not attack visitors. When we visited some areas were closed for visitors but still we could see lot of things. A must visit place.
Asia,Visited the monkey forest during our stay in Ubud. The best place if you want to get up close and personal with the monkeys. Its a lovely location and you can spend hours just walking around the area. They have certain feeding areas for the monkeys which is really cool.
Asia,"Situated in ubud,this place is gem, ancient hindu temples within forest and lots of monkey,they are everywhere,of every size,from tiny new born to bigger one,love to see them playing and enjoying life, follow guidelines of park staff and it would be a pleasant visit."
Asia,We loved every bit of time spent at monkey forest.Monkeys were generally peaceful unless you provoke then or ha e food in your hands.
Asia,"This is a beautiful forest with lovely trees n the greenery all over. The canopy of trees is wonderful. There are a lot of stone archtectures.The forest has a lot of monkeys. They r notorious. If you carry food n water they can grab it. And if you keep the bag n move away be sure that the things will be taken away. So one has to be careful. Its fun seeing them doing various activities like eating tapioca, removing the skin of fruits etc. There is also an art gallery where paintings are displayed n you may buy if u wish.On an average you can spend 2 to 3 hours ."
Asia,"This is a small jungle with walking pavement where you can see many moneys . Entrance is 80k IDR.

Nothing more , nothing less. Take your call"
Asia,"Good place to hang around, well maintained.
You will feel connected to nature, wild life and Hindu spiritual traditions all together.Ootimum time required is 2 hours."
Asia,"an only slightly challenging walk... good for most people... be prepared for the heat.
The reward: so much natural beauty and of course entertainment from The Monkeys!
"
Asia,"The Monkey forest is one of the popular tourist attractions of Ubud. Considered as a natural reserve, the forest is owned and managed by the local villagers. The forest is home to many long tailed monkeys and it is a visual treat to watch them in their natural habitat. As the monkeys can get wild at times, it is advisable to follow the park rules and avoid feeding them. However it is fascinating to see them play with each other, climb trees and canopies and sometimes imitate the visitors. The park is also known for various traditional temples which have got amazing intricate carvings and sculptures."
Asia,you have to walk a lot but the forest is thick so you don't get tired.there are guidelines what not to do. you can watch monkeys from close quarters and have fun
Asia,"This is really a treat to be surrounded by such beauty and so many monkeys. They are so amazing to just sit and watch.

Things to note:
Donâ€™t have tobacco or food in your backpack. They will jump on you and tear your bag open.

Donâ€™t wear jewelry.

Things that made me sad. Tourist were getting the famous monkey selfie and afterwards the guides would slap the monkey. So I didnâ€™t get one.

Also If monkey climbs you the guides come yelling and with sticks and hit the monkeys. So please donâ€™t let the monkeys on you. They do bite! If the monkeys will get in trouble donâ€™t encourage them.

"
Asia,"It was really fun, but seriously take care of your things. A monkey managed to open our backpack, stick his little hand inside and pull out a bottle of sunscreen. After that, he ran out to the sunset with it. Could have been a phone."
Asia,"It was a nice place to hanging out with your family or your partner. The forest has a nice view and friendly monkeys. The entrance ticket is not so expensive, and you can spend your time at the forest as long as you want. It will be a lil bit crowded during weekend, but the forest has a spacious area, so what are you waiting for? Let's find some fun in there."
Asia,"If you visit Ubud, do not forget to take a walk into the famous monkey forest. These wild monkeys are every where and some of them are real cheeky. We enjoyed our two and a half hours here. Try to come in the early morning before the tourist buses arrive."
Asia,We had a good walk and took funny pictures with the monkeys. Be careful they can steal your stuff. They donâ€™t bite though
Asia,"This sacred place is worth a visit. It's a nice walk in the shades with beautiful views, temples and of course lots and lots of monkeys. Just make sure you stick to the rules and you won't have to worry about cheeky monkeys!

"
Asia,"Ubud monkey forest is located at the central of Ubud, close to the main tourist resort and shopping area."
Asia,Nice place with a lot of monkeys. Don't feed them because it can be dangerous. Carry a stick in case they become agresive
Asia,"1. Entry ticket is 80K for adult, and 60K for kid
2. Obey the rule! Or yo will be attacked by the apes...
3. Wear comfortable shoes!"
Asia,"If you are a good person you love animals, itâ€™s a great place to visit. Absolutely better than a Zoo, because the monkeys are free and just live their life. Architecture and plants are so beautiful. Monkeys can be friendly, but still savage animals so let them do their choice and respect the rules!"
Asia,"The sacred monkey forest is something you have to do like a lot of other tourist things. These place gives money in employment and to the preservation of the animals.
Give it go."
Asia,"I like monkeys, but in the wild. This is such a tourist monkey trap. The become aggressive because they expect food. There is another monkey forest outside of town which is more baby friendly"
Asia,Super cool with fresh air becouse in area Flores and you can take picture with monkey. Many aktivite you can play there.
Asia,"nothing special but worthwhile to see, i felt poorly for the monkeys treated as show biz but thatâ€™s the folk"
Asia,"Not much really
monkeys everywhere in the world and there is nothing special or exciting there
ØµØ±Ø§Ø­Ù‡ Ù…ÙƒØ§Ù† Ø¹Ø§Ø¯ÙŠ Ù†ÙØ³ Ø§Ù„Ù‚Ø±ÙˆØ¯ ÙÙŠ Ø§Ø¨Ù‡Ø§ Ùˆ Ø§Ù„Ø·Ø§Ø¦Ù Ùˆ Ø·Ø±ÙŠÙ‚ Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø¯ÙŠÙ†Ù‡ ÙÙŠ Ø§Ù…Ø§ÙƒÙ† Ø§ÙØ¶Ù„ Ø¨ÙƒØ«ÙŠØ± ÙÙŠ Ø¨Ø§Ù„ÙŠ ØªÙ‚Ø¯Ø± ØªØ²ÙˆØ±Ù‡Ø§ Ù„Ù†Ø´Ø§Ù‡Ø¯Ø© Ø§Ù„Ù‚Ø±ÙˆØ¯ Ù…Ø«Ù„ Ø­Ø¯ÙŠÙ‚Ø© Ø­ÙŠÙˆØ§Ù† Ø¨Ø§Ù„ÙŠ Ùˆ Ø³ÙØ§Ø±ÙŠ"
Asia,Enjoy and the place very Clean also the monkeys are friendly. This forest is located at center of ubud so much fun and really love our trip.
Asia,"Monkeys are cute but be careful. They can snatch flip flops, glasses, and other things very fast. Then you would see they go somewhere distant and enjoy chewing..."
Asia,"As a monkey forest which is in the center of tourism activities, especially Ubud, of course this is a feature, Monkey forest is there because it is still preserved the preservation of the forest behind the hustle and bustle of the capital city of Ubud district. As a city that spoiled its guests for arts and culture and sculpture. As a guest when visiting here, it is a bit overwhelming to see a guest pampering apes with food or goods outside of the food okosystem and this makes the monkeys more spoiled with equipment outside the ecosystem. This should not be done so that the monkeys do not behave wildly to visitors or even spread to shops or residents' settlements just to look for goods or food. The manager must also think about this for the convenience of guests."
Asia,"If you're in Ubud, this is one place you must visit. The monkeys are crazy, make sure you don't wear sunglasses or have a bag pack otherwise they'll take it haha."
Asia,"I am an animal lover so I found walking in the forest watching monkies a great way to spend a couple of hours. They are comical, curious, cheeky, ribald and adorable. But let your common sense prevail - it's their forest, they roam free and they're wild animals. Respect that and you'll have a great time. No feeding them, no plastic or paper bags, leave your jewellery at home, don't try to touch them especially an infant (mama won't be too far away and you'll know about it if you do), don't look them in the eye (sign of aggression to a monkey) just chill, relax and watch around you and don't forget to look up in to the trees."
Asia,Let start to see classic panorama with funny monkey and there are temple inside of forest. Enjoy of fresh hair and high banyan trees surround.
Asia,"Large parking area, receptionist. Clean place and easy path to walk surrounding the place. Many monkey and temple. Big tree, small river and pond. Must visit while in Ubud"
Asia,Thought it would be toruist trap but it was like going on a jungle hike in a monkey zoo. Not depressing and very nice!
Asia,"The security guard are very impolite. 30 meters from ticket checking they ask that we have ticket or not. They say see us enter from other gate that later we confirmed there is no other gate. Maybe because we are locals?
We finally headed back to information desk and report our complaint then asking for a refund.
This is my 4th time to monkey forest and this one is a very disappointing.

"
Asia,"There are so many beautiful temples in Bali. The sacred monkey forest is truly unique. There is an abundance of monkeys, they are free to roam around as they please, they are not over or under fed or aggressive like in Uluwatu. You only really need 1 hour to experience the grounds. Highly recommend."
Asia,A bit expensive but actually worth it - lots of monkeys but watch out for them attacking and jumping on you - a bit scary at times - Great for photos though if you are brave!
Asia,"What a wonderful place. Over a thousand monkeys seemingly happy and free! If youâ€™re lucky the monkeys will come up to you so just stay calm and donâ€™t look at the monkeys in the eyes. One of them tried to steal my bracelet but luckily failed. Unfortunately, I saw a few people willingly hand over plastic bottles of water to the monkeys. Please donâ€™t be like that!"
Asia,Canâ€™t wait for my next trip to Bali to visit this place again. Itâ€™s so amazing how they keep on jumping around and play with each other . Some of them even pose for me to take photos
Asia,"Donâ€™t let other guides put you off by saying the monkeys are aggressive. We had some people try and take us to another monkey forrest. We almost did but opted for this big tourist attraction. So glad we did. The entry fee well worth it. So many staff, so professional, so clean! The monkeys were amazing and never bothered us and we got plenty close enough! The kids loved it. The park is really well done even without the added bonus of the monkeys!"
Asia,we stayed in ubud for birthday celebration.we visit monkey forest.Great place to explore it.Highly recommended
Asia,We went on our way back from a half day cycle ride. Itâ€™s cheap entry fee and the monkeys get up close. Definitely worth visiting
Asia,"Itâ€™s quite small and there are a lot of monkeys. If youâ€™ve never been close to monkeys before itâ€™ll be exciting and slightly terrifying. Itâ€™s a well kept forest walk though with some beautiful trees and foliage. Much of the stonework looks like itâ€™s been around a while, some of it is much more recent. None of the monkeys jumped on the kids heads, stole my wifeâ€™s handbag, or ate my cap- but we we dollowed the rules and behaved in a sensible manner unlike some uncouth individuals who were cruising for a bruising. Good fun and interesting, but control your expectations."
Asia,"There were a lot of monkeys at the forest. Pay attention to your values and follow the rules and you will be fine!
The entrance fee is 80.000 IDR per person, which is okay, not cheap but not too expensive, neither.

It wasn't too crowded in the morning, I'd suggest to avoid the peak times on weekends and late morning.
"
Asia,"The Monkey Forest in Ubud is great! We paid 80.000 each to enter and it is a fair price.
There are more than 1000 monkeys and they are free in there. We could even spot some on the streets in Bali, but it seems the forests are their real home!
I recommend a visit there"
Asia,"monkey forest ubud is one the famous place in Ubud, has around 1000 monkeys and very wide area of forest, inside of the forest we will see Grave yard, Hindus temple, holy water temple and river with spring water, the staffs are very friendly the forest are very well maintenance."
Asia,"Located in the center of Ubud. If you are walking around in Ubud's most crowded area, you'll find Sacred Monkey right in the center of it. You pay around Rp. 70.000 per person to get in.
There are probably hundreds of monkeys around. They are very mischievious and naughty and the most fun to to watch animal I would say!
As these are wild monkeys, dont do anything to them as they are fierce especially when it comes to food, and dont look them in the eye if possible as they see it as a challenge for dominance. If you just stroll around and just watch, you'll be OK. There are a lot of caretakers inside if you have any problem. The monkeys seem to be scared of them."
Asia,"Thereâ€™s a lots monkey here. You need to pay for check in here. Here is like a jungle with a lots of monkey, the air is fresh. You will need 1-2 hours inside this place."
Asia,"Previously I would have said give this attraction a miss. Badly behaved aggressive monkeys stealing items from visitors etc, poorly maintained areas and in some cases really dirty, but the entire park has now been rebuilt. A new entry, plenty of parking, a pleasant walk into the park. Gone are the sellers with bananas for the monkeys, now you canâ€™t feed them and the monkeys behave more as they would in the wild. There are feeding stations controlled by the keepers, you cannot touch the monkeys and they now ignore the visitors which means you can watch them instead of hanging on to your possessions as you had to do before. The whole experience for us was wonderful. Organised, enjoyable and now Iâ€™d recommend visiting."
Asia,"Good view monkey at sacred monkey forest sanctuary
Many monkey at here.
Good monkey and attractive monkey at here. Good palace.

Many Tourist at here.
Happy Holiday."
Asia,If you love monkeys and ancient temples this is the place for you. Very central in Ubud making it simple to get to. Full of monkeys and beautiful architecture to explore. Very well priced for any tourist attraction.
Asia,"As you could assume there where monkeys all over! Very nice surroundings with cool statues, some temples and a lot of forest. The feeling of actually being in the jungle made it a really cool experience. They also had more â€œzoo-likeâ€ spaces but they were open so the monkeys can roam around free. Good that there where signs with instructions on how to act around the animals. Big recommend when in Bali!"
Asia,"I have visited the monkey forest on many occasions and every time it is a pleasant experience! Itâ€™s really great to see the monkeys just as they are in their natural habitat. You are able to interact with them if they are interested in your head (they can jump on you) not to mention they are super cute. The sanctuary itself is also very beautiful, it feel great to be amoungst the trees away from the hustle and bustle of the surrounding streets. Will probably be back again :)"
Asia,"Hi! It's great vacation to come here see all those monkey freely to go anywhere like they happy, and also the visitor happy too"
Asia,"Went there last week and it was amazing experience ! I always wanted to get close to Monkey and tips that i can give to you for those who want to take picture with them, just come approach the monkey and do not do anything and stay calm. they will come to you without being aggressive, do not try to touch them, just let them do their things when they get close to you. Can't wait to be back."
Asia,"A trip to the wild ,but donâ€™t take any food or they will jump on you . For myself I just like to look and watch them."
Asia,"Loving Animals beauty place Temple River all is perfect place in Ubud Bali.
Big Area many monkey little bit naughty"
Asia,An experience that is a must if you visit Ubud. Set in lush forest where monkeys roam free and rule the roost There are many signs of do and dont But dont forget these are wids animals and can be un predictable. Leave them alone and they will leave you alone. Dont have any food on you or your just asking for trouble You will get fantastic photos of monkey families.But keep you children close
Asia,"A sacred monkey forest which located at the south of Ubud city as one of the most popular tourist attraction in Bali.
Highly recommended"
Asia,"Reasonably priced and worth taking the time to see. The baby monkeys are the cutest! Pay attention to the warnings about carrying items into the forest. The monkeys will, and do, snatch things."
Asia,Good place for visited with kids....don't bring transparent bag..monkey will come and lookout for some snack..
Asia,"It was good experience, the monkey were not so ugly and not so agresive due to well treated by the local villagers"
Asia,"We stayed just around the corner from the monkey forest. It gives you a good idea of life in the ancient times in the local countryside and area, plus the monkeys seem to have a good life. It's a large area, with various different areas including a big bathing area for them. It was 160,000 rupiah for a couple which is about Â£9.00."
Asia,"Since I love animals, this is one of my favourite places in Ubud. I've been to Ubud 3 times before and every time I have to visit the Monkey Forest. The monkeys are amazing to watch. I liked it more before when they allowed us to interact with them and feed them, but I guess the new rules are to protect both monkeys and humans ðŸ˜Š"
Asia,"I had low expectations for the monkey forest and am often skeptical of any tourist activity involving animals. The sanctuary was great fun. I was surprised by just how many monkeys were there! Be cautious as they come close and really donâ€™t seem to being around humans. It seems to be quite crowded in the afternoon (even during the off season), but the monkeys were very active."
Asia,"Simply great! They give you all the safety tips (which some folks donâ€™t follow, donâ€™t look directly at the monkeyâ€™s eyes) and i had one climb on my shoulders, pat me on the head, and try to steal my glasses. I didnâ€™t panic as the monkeys are friendly and put my glasses in my pocket. He looked in the hair on my head, then gave up. Lots of fun and educational."
Asia,Macaque Monkeys galore! Beautiful jungle right in town to visit. Many times religious ceremonies are going on that you can view.
Asia,"First time take my husband to visit monkey Forrest. Great place and a lots of crazy monkey, but its okay and fun. We had a great time here"
Asia,"Being an animal lover i just had to see this sanctuary filled with monkeys that would even be walking around on the street next to the forest.
An hour or two would be enough to walk around the sanctuary and look at cheeky monkeys.

It is open daily and entry time is from 8:30 am to 5:30 pm, entry fees are 50,000 Rupiah for adults for children is 40,000 Rupiah. Be careful and don't bring food with you when you go there they have a very good sense of smell and any plastic bag you might bring there could be perceived to have food in it and they might lunge on it.

Last warning don't ever ever walk around the forest holding food (bananas, coconuts) on the street cause they might follow you and make you give them your food, if you don't want to get rabies or anything else just give it up and throw it far away from you before it attacks you. Last picture shows the monkey who mugged me for a coconut lol."
Asia,"They hardly interacted with people as they were so busy eating and playing, the younger ones will climb on you if you put your arm out. I did however really enjoy watching a small group of British girls who did not read the signs and had their Pringleâ€™s snatched from them, they were really upset and I laughed a lot."
Asia,"Canâ€™t feed the monkeys, which is good as it prevents them from being aggressive over the food. But.... theyâ€™re not stupid! Keep your backpack zips closed, or even better leave it at home. The monkeys know how to make their way to the inside of your bag ðŸ˜‚ keep sunglasses and hats at home, as there are some curious cheeky monkeys there. If you want good photos, go early morning before the crowds of tourists get in."
Asia,If you want to see a real jungle with many monkeys then this place is for you. I gave 4 stars because there were places inside the sanctuary that werenâ€™t accessible for visitors or tourists and you pay the same price as it is open. There were interesting views to look at and a temple to explore passing through the river. Itâ€™s surrounded with many trees and monkeys playing and eating around. There were cleaners who always clean the monkeyâ€™s mess.
Asia,"my first time go to this place, its so lovely place but the monkey was angry i dont know why?? so the monkey bite me"
Asia,"9 February 2019.

This is the 6th bite (for no reason) I've personally seen in 3 years.

How many have I not seen?

The staff say it's ok. Walk 15 minutes to the clinic and they will wash it.

HOW ABOUT DRIVING THE PAYING CUSTOMER YOUR MONKEY BIT to the clinic?"
Asia,"This place is so cute and a lovely place if you want to get close to the monkeys in their (Sort of) natural environment. it's quite a big space, so you could spend a while here walking round and taking photos. At 50k to get in it's super cheap so definitely worth going in and seeing the monkeys!

It felt fairly busy when I went and apparently that was a quiet day, so I'd maybe check when you're going to go, I think it would be quite annoying if it's busy as there's a few one person each way stairs and walkways.

"
Asia,"Entering the monkey forest will cost you nothing more than a little pocket change. Unfortunately you cannot buy food or drinks in monkey forest (probably due to the monkeys making a mess out of everything)

The walking pads are nice, although i slipped on one of the paths since they didnt clean it well enough. Maybe a tip of attention?

Funny to see the monkeys play in such a cute way, keep your bags close and dont let go of anything or these little fellas will definitely take it from you!"
Asia,"It was a forest with full of monkeys, and tour guide is necessary to keep the monkeys away with rattan stick or something. The monkeys are wild, do not bring any catchy stuff or food, the other monkeys can grab your stuf from behind or above. Sometimes they exits forest and sits on the street or go to parking area.. some monkeys would snatch your stuff or shiny sunglasses or anything they think attract them, just walk normally and do read the information board."
Asia,Outstanding place really very nice for a visit. We as a family had a great day and walked l around the place so much so we were worn out by the end of the 3 hours we were there.
Asia,"Ive visited this location a couple of times now. Previously they sold bananas on site to feed the monkeys which provided up close and persknakk encounters. This policy changed to no feeding at all so the photos of monkeys sitting on you are no more, still there are more than enough monkeys inquisitive enough to grab to great photos. 50k Rp is a cheap destination and plenty to see and do jn Ubud"
Asia,No better way to see monkeys than at monkey forest in Ubud. As soon as we entered one monkey ran up to my 2-year old and stole the chips that was in his hand. WOW that was scary but funny at the same time. My wife had one little monkey climb all over her. It was a great couple of hours
Asia,"Bali Safe driver Ketuk, took us to see the monkey forest. It was a truly remarkable place.
I recommend this. It is a rare opportunity to see the monkeys looking healthy and free."
Asia,"I canâ€™t tell you how amazing it felt to have 3+ monkeys hanging around me, whilst playing with my necklaces. The key is to just remain calm! If they decide to go up to you itâ€™s because they like you and trust you. Just enjoy the moment. I will say be careful with your backpacks and jewelry! One of the monkeys successfully opened up my backpack which I thought was super funny. They also loved the beads I was wearing, the baby monkeys loved playing with them! Just enjoy this magnificent experience and feel lucky if these beautiful creatures choose you to hang out with â¤ï¸. On another note please do not touch the monkeys or look them in the eye. All of my one on one experiences with the monkeys were because they chose me. Even when they were on my arm I didnâ€™t make any sudden movements. Nor did I try and let them. Just stay in the moment and you will be fine â¤ï¸. If you choose to walk away while a monkey is on you then just slowly slowly walk away. Just because we donâ€™t know if any sudden movements will make them angry. Enjoy the ride â¤ï¸ enjoy the beautiful animals! Pics of me and my fellow monkey friends for your enjoyment!"
Asia,"I think the place has been taken care good, but the monkeys are too many for the guards to watch. Sometimes there was bad monkeys tried to steal things from visitor's bag, or just jump into your body. It will be pretty scary for some people, so if you go then go together, try not to walk alone, and don't bring backpack or anything that will attract the monkeys"
Asia,"I was hesitant to come here because I didn't want Monkeys jumping all over me. I'm really glad I came and unless you openly have food or stare at them in the eye, you can walk within feet of the monkeys and have a wonderful time. They are everywhere, and not only do you get to see them up close but you get to have a wonderful walk around the monkey Forest, which is very large. The entrance fee is about three to five dollars US."
Asia,"A lot of places with monkey in Bali but monkey forest in must visit one. They just renovate the entrance so it is more spacious and clean. The track also clear and the monkeys are a lot. Donâ€™t bring a water bottle as they will snatch it from you..
the entrance is IDR 50K for adults and IDR 40K for kids."
Asia,Great day out with the monkeys. They are cheeky so watch your belongings. Lovely creatures though and super friendly.
Asia,"I love attractions where I can wander and am not placed under any pressure to move quickly from one thing to another, and this is one. It was hard to tear myself away from watch the mothers sleeping with babies. Although I was wary about how monkeys can quickly become agressive, there were plenty of 'Monkey Wardens' spread around the park and information signs about how to keep yourself safe."
Asia,If youâ€™ve never seen monkeys before being in their own habitat and playing around you this is a great and safe spot to do so. Recommended
Asia,"Loved walking here seeing the monkeys ""monkeying"" around and taking pictures. One hopped on my back but did not harm me. Mainly because I am a wildlife enthusiast and did not react in a way to panic the animal. Do not engage or feed them, always maintain a safe distance and respect the nature around you. A good place to see birds and water monitors
"
Asia,"Worth seeing, but be prepared for crowded paths. And follow the official safety guidelines; you do not to be bitten by a wild monkey, do you?"
Asia,good place to see nature in midle of city ubud there are still have forest and monkey.good recomended to came at monkey forest ubud
Asia,"The place is good, have many monkey, take picture with monkey but the ticket very expensive and monkey take we are sun glass."
Asia,"This beautiful sacred monkey forest is definitely a must see ! They are running around free with lots of spacing! But remember, hold on tight to your belongings! These cuties just want to take your things at any given opportunity!"
Asia,"We went there with my teenager kids, my daughter was a little afraid of monkey, but the monkey there was tame, not naughty. Lots of staff are working to ensure our safety. Bathroom is clean, place is pretty nice to bring guest from overseas."
Asia,A great place to see these cute monkeys hanging around the little forrest. a must see place when visiting Ubud
Asia,"A must visit place if you are in Bali obviously in Ubud area. This is more than just typical zoo experience but you can literally interact & see the all around monkeys daily activity.
"
Asia,"amazing must do in Ubud Bali foot lose and facy free be carefol that love to play and tack everything off you that thaycane,, sweet to feed tham,, my kids hade the best time,, in this habitat made posable by the local kings"
Asia,"The monkeys are well behave as long as you follow the guide's instructions. If you ask one of the guides for a photo, they will let you have a selfie with one of the monkey."
Asia,"I'll make this a simple review. This was one of the highlights... And I got bit. It wasn't bad. The forest is gorgeous and packed with monkeys. I had three climb on my head and back and break into my backpack. Then one I sat next to reached over, grabbed me, and bit my arm. Yet... I would recommend it to anyone. It was amazing. So cute, so expressive, such a beautiful environment for them. Highly recommend."
Asia,"A big park, where you get to see a lot of monkeys, watch out because they are really nauty LOL, they will try to steal"
Asia,"We visit Ubud monkey forest as part of our Ubud tour with Peaceful Bali Tour. The forest are clean, and there are many place for taking photo. The baby monkey very funny."
Asia,"If youâ€™re an adventure lover, you should definetely come to this place! Just be careful and read all the instructions before getting in! The monkeys are very nice and funny and we really enjoyed this experience"
Asia,"Well, itâ€™s interesting. Nothing I have not seen before , but itâ€™s always interesting to see dozens of free monkeys in the forest ..."
Asia,"We enjoyed our visit, told not to even think to touch the monkeys since they can be aggressive .
The local staff are helpful and happy to help with taking pictures.
The monkey's seem to be happy and well taken care of.
"
Asia,This was one of the best things we did in Ubud. The monkeys are really cute and they live in a magical place. Worth to spend there 1-2 hours at least. Just don't touch or feed them! :)
Asia,"In spite of near the shopping zone, you can enjoy the wild world. Take care monkeys sliping your back and advent to steal your drink bottle or so."
Asia,"It was a good experience as long as you FOLLOW THE RULES! Do not provoke the monkeys, do not tempt them with outside food, do not try and touch them. Let them come to you naturally or i promise you it will get ugly very quickly. It was fun experience for sure and it was nice when the monkeys do come to you. Just keep your bags closed and your food secure. They can open zippers. A monkey opened my daughterâ€™s bag and stole her lollipop."
Asia,The monkey forest was amazing!! Very cool to see the monkeys run a round and can tell they are well taken care of. Loved it!
Asia,"How special to see Indonesian macaque monkeys up close and free to do and go as they please.

They are well taken care of, loved and treasured by the staff and locals.

Please treat the animals with respect.
They are not domesticated or tame animals. They are wild animals used to humans.
"
Asia,"Cool place, but too many hipster tourists not following the rules of the park...getting too close and touching the monkeys just to get a laugh from their tattooed bros and a â€œcoolâ€ instagram photo. ONE AND DONE"
Asia,"If you come to Ubud it is almost obligatory to visit the monkey forest. It is interesting though sometimes the monkeys can feel threatening to visitors. Absolutely follow all the posted rules especially those about food.

It has been a few years since we last visited and theyâ€™ve â€œmodernizedâ€ it quite a bit. The small gravel lot is gone and the ad hoc ticket and banana sellers as well as the muddy path in. Now they have a large parking lot, modern gate house with toilets and raised paths into the forest. The paths are now well marked and clean. There are fewer monkeys, though enough, except at feeding time when many will show up. Overall, it is less exciting though much safer than before.

Keep your small kids in your arms, though, and enjoy a unique experience."
Asia,The experience and seeing all these monkeys close by is just amazing. It is located in the heart of ubud whereby you'd spend around 1 hour playing and watching monkeys in their natural habitat
Asia,"My kids were very excited to walk among the monkeys. The forest is also beautiful and seems authentic. There are a number of rules to follow and if you do, there shouldnâ€™t be a problem. Itâ€™s a fun and entertaining walk which you can do in one or two hours and then stroll down to the Ubud market. The staff at the forest were very friendly and even accommodated a monkey selfie. Box checked âœ”ï¸."
Asia,"This place is one of the significant sight seeing in Bali. The Ubud Monkey Forest is a nature reserve and Hindu temple located in Ubud, Bali Indonesia.I like it alot when I came.I saw the monkeys eating,Swimming ,climbing and jump on some women.The
bad thing when monkeys having sex near the temple my little daughter thought the male
hit the female.In my opinion it wonderful place ,eductional and let you chance to see
different kind of Apes.It could be scary for some people. 100% I will come again in my next trip to Bali."
Asia,"Visiting Ubud Monkey Forest was simply amazing. The forest was very green.
The surrounding nature was very Ubud like. The charming Monkies were entertaining. It was little scary at first sight, we were warned not to touch or feed them. Do not wear dangling earrings. This attraction was one of the highlights of Bali including the Bali swing.

SEE photos."
Asia,"at first I was reluctant to visit a place full of monkeys that can steal your staff or attack you, but when we visited this place I knew it was a nice place to experience few hours in a jungle and learn more about the way that monkeys live. be careful not to take food or backpacks, you may be a target of one of the hundreds of monkeys"
Asia,"It was a great experience visiting the Monkey Forest in Ubud. The most thing I liked in this place was its accessibility for wheelchair since my husband can't walk, it was so easy for him exploring this touristic attraction. I recommend paying a visit to the Monkey Forest especially for those Monkey lovers.."
Asia,The monkey park is a nice walk around for a few hours. Child friendly. You'd need from an hour to two hours to walk around. Early morning is still quite and feeding time which can be quite entertaining.
Asia,Nothing excite us as Monkeys are common sight in Bali and paying extra money to enter the park to see monkeys in my opinion is not worth it.Just follow rules stated in the board to avoid any unwanted incident after all they are wild animal.
Asia,"The entrance fee to this sanctuary is 80,000 IDR when I visited two weeks ago. Do come in the morning when there are less crowd. There are lots of monkeys running around so do be careful with your belongings. The sanctuary is beautiful and I spent an hour here just walking around. It is worth a one time visit but I wouldn't return."
Asia,"I couldn't believe the number of monkeys walking all around me. It was a little scary at first because you would not know when they may misbehave and charge at you. However, almost all of them were well behaved. Such a beautiful place being with nature."
Asia,"Truth be told, we went to the Monkey Forest to see the forest rather than the monkeys. I'd seen beautiful pictures of the ancient trees and I wanted to see for myself. Indeed, the cool forest contained many beautiful and amazing trees. The monkeys were very cute too but they were usually surrounded by gawking tourists. We weren't keen on some of the depictions on the statues. The visit would have been more enjoyable if we didn't have to stop so often for people to take photos."
Asia,"Great place to come up close with monkeys. They're used to the presence of people and are domesticized. Despite the warning signs, we saw a monkey stealing someone's phone and another being slightly aggressive as a tourist tried to physically interact with it.

Well worth the entrance fees."
Asia,Great time! I was initially terrified of being attacked by the monkeys but had a super time and would highly recommend people going there.
Asia,"The enterance was 80000 idr ! I guess expensive than most other attractions . Parking fee for bikes is 3000 idr. Try going there during ceremony. I went during a ceremony (forgot the name) it was colorful and musical to see. It's a dense jungle so cool . Avoid carrying food items in the sanctuary as this may attract or infuriate the monkeys- u don't want a bite. Take care of belongings, monkeys are smart"
Asia,"Loved the morning walkthrough The Sacred Monkey Forest. I went in the morning around 9:30am and the weather was just right since it was still a little cool.

Wear comfortable shoes as it may be quite a walk depending on the route you choose to take. I was able to catch breakfast time for the monkeys so that was a little entertaining."
Asia,"Lots of monkeys! At first I wasn't sure to come here but glad we did. The lush greenery surroundings of this place is amazing. Interesting trees, waterway, temple, statues, around the sanctuary. There are many park attendants scattered around to deal with monkeys when they get rowdy. Just be sure to follow the rules."
Asia,"Pros: Lots to learn about monkeys, great for photo opportunities, well-maintained sanctuary.

Tip: There are reported cases of aggressive monkeys and monkeys that jump on your back so read the instructions very well and always be vigilant. Do not bring brightly colored bags."
Asia,"When in Bali, don't miss this place. Its a nice experience to be among the monkeys. When you walk around, just enjoy to be with them, respect their territory and relax."
Asia,My daughters enjoyed this place so much. It was a unique experience for us. We took pictures with monkeys but we were very careful not to offend them. We kept distance from them because of the possibility that the monkeys will harm us.
Asia,"This attraction boasts of a real forest with old trees providing a good canopy over the place. Signs are everywhere that you will not get lost inside. There is also a stream running through the place giving it a more forest-like appeal. Best of all, the stars of the place (the monkeys), are everywhere going about their usual activities despite the presence of human beings. A very relaxing place to be in Bali."
Asia,"The place is big, you might spend like 30 minutes to see all walking. Monkeys are not aggressive and you can walk among them."
Asia,"Upon arrival, you will be assisted by someone here. I suggest not to go alone since the monkeys will really come near you if you're bringing something. The guides will be the one to feed the monkeys and they will have you carry the monkeys on your shoulder.
They are kinda heavy and smelly (lol), but other than that, the visit was great.
The place is great since it is clean, quiet, and cool since there are a lot of trees.
Booked my tour in Ubud through Klook."
Asia,"We were all in awe to visit this place because the locals seemed to be proud of it. At the entrance, we were met by younger monkeys. We were surprised when one naughty monkey landed on her shoulders, another one jumped and held my leg, they were so playful but we are not supposed to hold them or feed them, we were instructed, to continue with our walk and to mind them. The attention of one foreigner was called when she started holding a baby monkey. We were told that if said smelled like human, it will be killed by her mother. The experience was overall fun and refreshing."
Asia,"This Bali attraction is a must see especially when you visit the Ubud area. This forest is sacred and is filled with monkeys which residents feed and offer prayers to (as what I have observed). There were cute ones but there were silly monkeys too, so you have to remove your earrings (especially pearls coz they'll think its a peanut haha as per our guide) and no bringing of plastics (which send them signals that you have food). Basically if you love nature, you'll enjoy strolling in this interesting forest plus the little temples you can see inside. If you're lucky enough to bump into one of the personnel, you can seek assistance to have you taken a picture with the monkeys (like a pose with a monkey seated in your head, shoulder or hand.)"
Asia,"My friend wanted to take a photo with the monkeys here in the Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary.. As we arrived at this place, they're like 4-6 couples taking their Pre-Nup shoot here wearing their traditional Balinese Wedding Attire. At first first I was a bit scared as this monkeys are not friendly animals, but to my surprise they're cute and somewhat friendly... We took a lot of selfies with the monkeys and it was hilarious as hell!! I had a really fun time at this place."
Asia,"Amazing given the temples and the sheer numbers of monkeys, but besides that a typical asian rain forest"
Asia,"We got there just after it opened and it was relatively quiet walking around to begin with. Saw tonnes of macaques, lots of babies too. They seemed happy enough."
Asia,The babies were really cute and feisty. They are so used to stealing your stuff itâ€™s like they have a hoarding problem just to get a reaction from people. Bad behaviors are still funny in animals unless they get ahold of your glasses or hat.
Asia,We just walk from our hotel to sacred monkey forest the entrance was amazing .... when we walk through theres a lot of stone sculptures...and at the entrance you can see the meaning of each entity that was curved so my son were so thrilled to see more and its nice to see that they are enjoying though its a little bit hot but theres this area down the temple that was soooo amazing its like youre in a scene of a movie bigtrees and roots theres monkeys all around u but you dont have to worry because theres a lot of staff to look on the behavior of the monkeys just dont open your bag in front of them or they will get your stuff. Just follow the rules posted .
Asia,"This is not an all day trip. We enjoyed walking around the forest and seeing the monkeys, which can get close to.

Whilst we were there, they were consistently fed and well behaved. Nothing unto-wards happened, like bags being snatched or sunglasses as seen on television. A really calm environment to walk around in and see beautiful creatures."
Asia,Great experience seeing the monkeys in their natural habitat. Does smell and lots of poo but that's expected. Worth the experience. Be aware if you take a rucksack or any kind of bag monkeys will try and get in. Don't keep anything in outside pockets in rucksacks. We saw a monkey take someone's hotel key as it was in the outside pocket. It's fairly big so I did get abit bored. Lots of tourists and everyone is warned not to feed or touch the animals.
Asia,"The monkey forest of Ubud on Bali is located around three Hindu temples. Several hundred long-tailed macaques live in this forest. In general, the monkeys of Ubud are less aggressive in comparison to the monkeys in the Uluwatu temple South of Bali. Nevertheless, these monkeys are still wild animals, and the warnings at the entrance of the sanctuary and at the food places should be taken seriously by the visitors. Among the visitors, I have seen idiots who liked to interact with the monkeys (giving plastic bottle to them, shout at them to see funny reactions â€¦) and move as close as possible to them in order to have some stupid pictures. A quick look through some galleries shows many pictures taken with the camera directly in the face of these animals. Further, the more you carry with you the more things at your make the monkeys curious, so that visitors should decide if it is really necessary to carry bags etc. with them.

Go through the forest, leave the animals in peace, keep some distance (especially when you make pictures), do not carry around unnecessary things, donâ€™t stare into the faces of these animals, and the change is high that you will have some fun."
Asia,"This money forest is very clean and well maintained. The staff keep the monkeys under control and donâ€™t allow them to steal food or personal belongings from the guests
Worth the entrance fee."
Asia,It was a great experience. The forests and the stone sculptures were interesting. The monkeys were not behaving badly to my pleasant surprise. Peaceful surroundings.
Asia,"Both myself and my husband we really enjoyed our visit to Sacred Monkey forest Sanctuary!
Apart from the gorgeous monkeys we had the chance to attend a Balinese ceremony which happened inside the sanctuary.
We liked every minute in there!"
Asia,The forest is big and you start seeing monkeys right from the entrance. The monkeys are very hospitable and amicable. The information available is very educational about these monkeys.. The little ones are adorable!
Asia,"We went there in our 2nd day
It was raining outside but still we have been able to see the monkeys so close .

Its nice to take kids there
"
Asia,This is not worth the effort. just a bunch of monkeys fooling around. the cost of entry is also quite high.
Asia,"A nice walk, lots of monkeys and 3 temples to see. A few souvenir shops there as well. A cafe was there in the main building."
Asia,"Definitely one of our favourite place visited. Our driver was great, and proposed this place amongst with few others, but this one was stunning. We spent time with the monkeys, on their natural habitat, just a beautiful moment, that we could do again and again ðŸ˜Š"
Asia,"This Sacred Monkey forest was the Highest recommend places to visit so hence went here. Tickets for me was IDR 100,000 per person which isnâ€™t too bad. You wonâ€™t find monkeys as soon as you enter the forest. Youâ€™ll have to go more further and youâ€™ll see a lot and lot of monkeys. 95 percent of the monkeys there were friendly and not scared. It was so nice to see them do stuff. In all, this is also a very beautiful forest. At some parts, it felt like a scene from a fairy tale. Itâ€™s thatâ€™s beautiful. However there are so many DONTâ€™s here. There are boards everywhere saying that â€œyou canâ€™t do thisâ€ â€œyou canâ€™t do thatâ€ â€œdonâ€™t go hereâ€. Like the staff in there were also not letting to enjoy. Anyways I would definitely recommend this place to visit if youâ€™re in Bali."
Asia,"I guess I expected it to be more impressive. It can be done in an hour if you take your time. Be careful, the monkeys are aggressive. Several times they jumped on visitors."
Asia,"This is fun spot if you like animals in general and monkeys in particular. If you are frightened by animals who are free and not in cages this isnâ€™t the place for you.

The sanctuary is a beautiful forest within the city. Itâ€™s full of ancient trees, sculptures and fountains.

You have to follow the rules and not disturb the animals as they are unpredictable. They can jump on you or try grabbing one of your belongings.

Kids will love it!"
Asia,That's how I felt at the forest. It was very beautiful and the monkeys are not annoying. They would still grab somethings if tempted. The art work and sculptures are very interesting. We spent about two hours walking around and went to centeral ubud. You can walk or use the shuttle bus to get there ðŸ•¶
Asia,"Monkeys are everywhere

Nothing special about this place.
I donâ€™t recommend visiting it, itâ€™s risky as the monkeys might attack you or stole your stuff."
Asia,"It was fun to see the monkeys however the forest is too small in my opinion and it was limited, given the time it took us in Baliâ€™s traffic I donâ€™t think it was worth visiting.

"
Asia,"Monkeys are everywhere inside this jungle with huge numbers. They are funny ðŸ™‚
You can see them doing funny stuff.
You can see their spike hair style ðŸ˜¬"
Asia,"Dana was our driver and guide.
He is very punctual and friendly.
Always attentive and knowledgeable which makes our trips more interesting.

Great to have Dana showing us around."
Asia,"I had a perception that Monkey Forest was just a park. But it was much more than that. It's monkey sanctuary with beautiful bridges, huge trees and monkeys.

The place has many photos spots and a different experience from other tourists attractions in Bali.

Tips
Carry mosquitoes repellent. Also donâ€™t engage with monkeys."
Asia,"Yeap good place to see monkeys. If you are lucky, get one of the guides there to take photo for you with the monkey. They have a technique to take a photo to make it look like the monkey is taking a selfie with you.

80k per pax for entry."
Asia,"You canâ€™t visit Ubud and not go to Monkey Forest - the monkeys are confident and inquisitive, you will be fine as Long as you do not have food in your bag or are carrying anything...if you get down Low or sit donâ€™t be surprised if you have a monkey get onto your back / shoulders. You will get some great photos and will be an enjoyable half day activity"
Asia,"Fun to watch monkeys in natural habitats, sometimes even fighting over territory. Every now and then you'll see some monkeys gettin it on lol. There can be certain spots where alot of monkeys run past you, not for those who are afraid of animals for sure.

1 minor gripe is they should focus a little more on cleanliness since we need to be alert on stepping on monkey poo, and also they should make it mandatory for visitors to wash their hands/face upon entry/exit of the park."
Asia,"Nice walk in this tropical forest with, obviously, monkeys everywhere.
It is good to be cautious as they will try to steal anything from you: hat, sunglasses, handphone or even open your backpack...
Also ppease to follow the instruction, for example do not feed them or try to grab them...
Overall nice place with also some small art exhibition...
Enjoy and do not litter :)
"
Asia,"We spent few days in Ubud, and this monkey Forest just close to our hotel. Just walked to reach it. Beautiful forest with a lot of monkey inside. We bough some bananas in the entrance to feed them. Overall this is nice little forest, fresh air and clean."
Asia,"Magical vibe, beautiful place. This is perhaps the main attraction that must be visited in Ubud. However, it is necessary to be very careful with monkeys and it is better not to approach them close and not to touch."
Asia,"A great experience to walk around and watch the monkeys.
Cost 80,000 rupiahs pp to get in.
Not allowed to take food or plastics in
Just be aware that you are really close to the moneys and some do jump on you.
It is enjoyable to watch them play and jump on trees and swing from branch to branch
Worth a visit"
Asia,"Number of keys and a forest inside a city is bit surprising. As we had young kids, we didnt stay longer. As long as we follow the rules written there, no harm from monkeys :)"
Asia,"My partner and I visited the sanctuary towards the end of the day. The park closes at 6pm and we were there at around 4.30pm. We decided to go for it since it is said you could finish the sanctuary within an hour. True enough, we finished in an hour. You may think it might get crowded with it being such a popular tourist destination, but because the area is so big, the crowd disperse and you're pretty much enjoying the sights of the monkeys. I've seen a woman being harrased by a monkey and a man being treated like a chair (yes the monkey was on his head!) but this shouldn't deter you from visiting the sanctuary. In fact, those two visitors sure had a chuckle. Respect the rules and you will have an enjoyable time. It's amazing to see how the mummy monkeys always stay close to their babies, the alpha monkeys scaring the others away when they walk towards the food and couples picking hair for their partners. We even saw a monkey doing some rolling, as if it was making dough! They're so much alike us humans!"
Asia,"Interesting to see lots of monkeys
The monkeys will open your backpack and steal stuff
We saw a woman get a superficial monkey bite
Overall cool experience"
Asia,"the monkey forest is not big - can finish within one couple of hours , but nicely designed and great for a walk with family."
Asia,I was honestly scared by some of the monkey's aggressive behaviour but I managed to snap one with it!
Asia,"I liked this park and seeing the monkeys was great. They are quite used to humans and during my visit I didn't see any aggressive monkeys. When I was taking a picture, 3 monkeys climbed me! So if you're scared of monkeys I wouldn't recommend it. I was fine with it, had a good laugh. But apparently you need to be careful with that, they warned us not to let them climb us and especially get to our head. All in all it was an ok experience, nothing too special."
Asia,"To start it off, I'm not too great a fan of monkeys, so my review may be slightly coloured by that.

The monkey forest is a large section of forest that is around Ubud main town. Its got hundreds, if not thousands of monkeys living in the area and if you like monkeys, this is your thing. (Monkeys in Singapore tend to be a bit more aggressive than the ones here, but do explain why I don't really like them)

There are paths running through the forest and monkeys everywhere. I would recommend you walking through the entire forest and all the paths, it should not take out more than 1 hour to 1.5 hours. There are fascinating areas with pools for monkeys to play, feeding areas, ravines with long banyan tree roots and bridges that make for nice photo ops.

Monkeys here have no fear of humans and will happily run to you and perch on your shoulder. Don't go if you have a fear of them, I saw several tourists run with fear when a monkey tries to hop onto their legs. One monkey perched on the shoulder of my friend, and, I kid you not, started to unzip the bag to root around it in. I chased it off before it could grab anything, so if you intend on going there, try not to have bags that are easily opened or can be rummaged through (Good advice for anyone travelling, even without monkeys)."
Asia,"Beautiful walk that takes about an hour to complete. HIDE EVERYTHING ! donâ€™t leave your bottles , glasses or hats out cause the monkeys are smart! We walked around with 2 small children and were fine. A monkey did climb on my bag while I was walking but I just tried to act calm and continue on my way and it ended up jumping off
I come here at least twice a year and am always weary of the monkeys . Iâ€™ve seen them bite and Attack people but this time it seems like there is more personnel around to help tourists. Yes you will still run the chance of having a monkey jump on you or bite you(theyâ€™re wild animals) but I felt more comfortable with the amount of pro personnel there was"
Asia,"The park is lush green and very pleasing to the eye but it isnâ€™t maintained that well. Thereâ€™s tons of monkeys and most of them are quite aggressive. When we visited a couple of monkeys were tugging at a ladyâ€™s dress and then suddenly all of the monkeys started making loud noises and chasing one another. Me and the other parents with toddlers scrambled to protect our little ones and then made our way straight to the exit.

For charging a decent entry fee, the park management must at least do something to make peopleâ€™s experience more pleasant."
Asia,"Size of forest was just nice for a quick wander around for an hour and a half. Entrance fees were 80k/pax. Keepers were very friendly and monkeys were tame and non aggressive. Only thing is there are mosquitos/flies so bring a repellant along! Also, try to exit at where the main entrance is if not youâ€™ll have to make a detour along a motorcycle path which was what we had to do!"
Asia,"The best thing about the monkey reserve is simply that we got to experience a unique habitats where monkeys are free to roam. Itâ€™s a large beautiful park. Not a great deal of interaction with the monkeys as I was anticipating. Was hoping one would try and steal my hat or other such mischief. Liked, did not love."
Asia,"Very interesting if you like to see the monkeys in the forest, enjoyed the walk in the forest and the monkeys great and small . They are in geenral friendly but be careful sometimes they can be close to you and grap something if you don't pay attention. Great for childeren, the forest rangers are paying a lot of attention to the people to see if people also ""behave"" against the monkeys. A lot to see temples, waterfalls, great forrest. Take your time to enjoy the walk and the forrest. Must see if you like forrest and monkeys"
Asia,Adult price is Rp. 80k/ea and children at Rp. 60k/ea. Place is relatively small but one can spend 1hr easily walking along the walkways and steps. There are many friendly monkeys that allow capturing moments. Staff is courteous and there to help in case of any emergency. Getting close to the monkeys is forbidden. Do not carry food in your bags as the monkeys can smell and go after you. The place is well maintained and clean with splendid views. Overall a rating of 3 out of 5 (mainly due to overly high price and lack of interactive sessions with these pre-human species).
Asia,If you follow the recommendations you will enjoy this walk with the monkeys. Remove water bottles and keep an eye on your bags.
Asia,"1-2hr visit. Make sure you secure your belongings(backpack, water bottle etc) Do not bring any food or eat in front of the monkeys."
Asia,It is definitely worth a visit even though you have to ensure you follow the rules stated if not the money might hassle you!
Asia,The monkeys were not aggressive. Some were friendly enough to let you sit next to them. The archtecture was beautiful. It was nice walking through the forest especially on a hot day. One of the exits lead to Jalan Monkey Forest where we did a lot of shopping and of course a foot massage.
Asia,"Yeah, this was kind of fun. However I've stayed at Bingin beach and some amazing places around South East Asia. I've seen a of of Monkeys. My partner hasn't seen any monkeys though, and she finally got the chance to not only see but also have a monkey on her shoulder, It's ok, and probably great for kids as it's pretty cheap if you actually happen to be in Ubud as a family."
Asia,"We grew up around wild monkeys, in the part of India where we come from. The primary reason for going here was to feed the monkeys and the experience the Temples - you canâ€™t feed them anymore, and the Temples are cordoned off. :( They are locked, hence just a peek-a-boo.
If you grew up in parts of the world where monkeys are â€œnormal everyday animalsâ€ ðŸ˜ donâ€™t bother going here - itâ€™s filled with amused tourists trying to take a shot with monkeys 5 feet apart ðŸ˜‚ Too commercial; unless you want to stop by to drop in a donation ðŸ’"
Asia,"Seeing monkeys in the wild is not unusual in Singapore but it was still worth the visit with some beautiful walks if not a little undulating and slippery so wear suitable footwear.
It rained whilst we were there so no surprise the monkeys took shelter so be aware in wet weather."
Asia,"I had worried to visit Monkey Forest in Bali due to some testimony from some friends that monkeys in Bali are naughty and like to steal foods drinks and other items. But it was totally wrong when I visit Sacred Monkey Forest in Ubud. They all well behaved, enjoy their own foods without stealing or disturbing the visitors. The place in here is clean and well maintained, the staffs are very kind and communicative to give more informations about the monkeys and that place.

We enjoyed the traditional of Bali dance inside there and of course itâ€™s free rather than need to pay in some places.

The entrance fee is IDR 60.000 (domestic rate) more higher compare with others monkey forest in Bali. Itâ€™s worth it to pay for my own safety and better place."
Asia,"We stop here on our full day trip in Bali. Our kids loved this place, a lot of monkeys, and they stay every where on this little forest. They had welcomed us at the gate, and apparently they were rather tame. Some monkeys also try to get the bananas that we carry. Amazing experience."
Asia,"The place have gone through some refurbishments & expansion since our last visit some 10yrs ago thus glad we dropped by. It was nice for an up close experience with the monkeys if otherwise we would not had back home. We probably spent 30-45mins onsite, would have been longer if it had not been that we were exhausted by our earlier rafting."
Asia,"Respect the rules after all, youâ€™re a guest

Donâ€™t dress in bright colours as you might be mistaken for a fruit.

Keep your hands out of your pockets as this is a sign youâ€™re hiding something of interest."
Asia,"Itâ€™s great place to see the monkeys on their natural habitat!
Entrance fee itâ€™s extremely cheap and itâ€™s well maintained!
"
Asia,"Visited in December, it was very hot. The place is beautiful but December temperatures were hard to manage with a 2 year old. Plus I felt we were interfering in the life of monkeys."
Asia,"This is a nice little sanctuary with lots and lots of macaque monkeys around. It's pretty interesting to visit. There are temples inside the sanctuary too. I'm particularly happy that they don't have different entrance fee price for foreign visitors, unlike some other places in Indonesia. 80k is worth it."
Asia,"There is nothing much to see. It is nice but if you donâ€™t have time, you can skip it. Do not wear hats, sunglasses or anything catchy. Also, make sure your bags are closed do that the Monkeys do not grab your stuff."
Asia,It's one of the main attractions. Just do not take any food of any kind with you! The monkeys are intelligent and can be aggressive if they see food or even food packaging. They love Pringles chips for example.
Asia,Nice temples with lots of monkeys. Pls make sure you do not bring or offer food to the monkeys as they may get aggressive. You may spend 2 to 3 hours here as its quite huge.
Asia,"As the name says it - forest filled with monkeys. Mischievous ones. Make sure you don't bring bottle water else they'd be so curious and will get it from you. Always keep a safe distance.

It's nice to see that they are all well fed and look healthy."
Asia,"This monkey park was a bit of a let-down as it was basically just a small compound with nothing much to see other than monkeys. The few temples that were in the compound were not open to public and there were no information signboard to read and understand more about the monkeys. If you've been to other monkey parks in Southeast Asia, this attraction can be skipped."
Asia,"Entrance fees is Rp80k per person. Unless you love monkeys (the macaque kind), there is not much to do. The 2 temples inside were closed when we were there."
Asia,"Also known as Ubud Monkey Forest, home of the Balinese Long tailed monkeys - it is one of Ubud's holiest, conservation, and economical site. Located in the village of Padangtengal, ticket costs around 80K IDR for adult. The ticket is worth it considering it helps with the conservation of the species plus you get to experience and entertain first hand the monkeys roaming freely in the forest. It is not scary because the monkeys are well trained and behave but since their wild animals please always be on alert and never bring food and drinks while you walk to avoid them stealing the food. Also do not touch or taunt them to avoid any unwanted reactions. To my delight we enjoyed walking along the park - we are not scared because of many tourists and they are well behaved. Sometimes they get rattled or there is commotion if they are playing or bickering as well food is on the table. The park guides serve them vegetables and fruits which tourists and visitors could witness first hand how they feed them and how they react and eat. So many species of trees and plants are within the park some are indeed very tall trees. We really enjoyed this park and truly one of a must visit attraction when you visit Ubud in Bali, Indonesia."
Asia,"We were visiting the forest with a 2 year old baby in a stroller. Our driver/guide informed us a bit about the things we shouldnâ€™t do but he did not accompany us inside. We thought it was going to be a breeze since we only intend to be there for half an hour to see the statues and take some pictures. On our way further inside, we were suddenly surrounded by monkeys. They were trying to take our stroller but the guards did not do anything. We asked for help but only other tourists were willing to do so. In the end, we only took this picture inside our car. It was our worst experience in our whole Bali trip."
Asia,"My first time in Bali... Woth a group of friends, we come to this Monkey forest. The whole attraction was wonderful. Many monkeys roaming around."
Asia,Part of the itinerary in a day trip to Ubud. Lots of monkeys wandering around entertaining us. A must see when in Bali.
Asia,"Before the trip, I was informed that it is not worth visiting this place due to the high admission fees (80k) and the monkeys can be found in other places. However, if you are in Ubud, you can still visit this Sanctuary for the monkeys and temple as there are other attractions in the area. The sanctuary is quite big so can explore the whole area and the large crowds are all disperse."
Asia,"The monkey forest is amongst the most visited places in ubud. In my opinion the tickets are over priced for a such a small tour. Our tour ended within 30-40 mins where for the price should have lasted longer. Nevertheless, it was an amazing experience"
Asia,Itâ€™s located at the center of Ubud. We were shocked to see so monkeys in one place. We actually had a very short time since we were late and they usually close by 6.30. Ticket counters close by 5.45. Its a small forest but well designed and maintained. Everywhere you see you spot only monkeys in different sizes. Itâ€™s lovely see them fight and jump around. You need to be careful as they can harm you if you play fool with them. There are many staff around who would help you in case if needed and they also do have a first aid centers. Itâ€™s a must visit place if you in Ubud.
Asia,If you havenâ€™t seen monkeys itâ€™s a nice place to take some photos. If you have seen monkeys before itâ€™s not a must do. It has a entrance fee not sure whether itâ€™s worth it.
Asia,Nice forest with a lot of monkey- and no they don't bite if you don't behave like an idiot. There are like 100 warning signs:)
Asia,"I went here today with my girlfriend, had an amazing time, the staff working there were very friendly and helpful, and the monkeys don't seem to care about the people too much, they just run around doing their own thing beside you. Great experience for all ages, would definitely recommend!"
Asia,"I was very impressed indeed with this sanctuary. The management of it appears to be world class. It is clean, well maintained, professionally staffed, well-signed, and beautifully located in natural forest. Although I have lived for many years in countries where the long-tailed macaque (Macaca fascicularis) is endemic, this sanctuary provided a great opportunity to observe the monkeys close up in a relatively natural environment.

Although crowded just before lunch, the size of the sanctuary allows you not to feel overwhelmed by other visitors, but if I go back again I would make a point of going at opening time (08:30) or 90 minutes before closing (06:00).

A lovely place, and highly recommended."
Asia,"Such a great experience, the monkeys kept to themselves and ate their food. We went in the afternoon, there were no issues with naughty monkeys. Totally worth seeing"
Asia,Lots monkey in forest there are some staff that look after you around the forest with stick if monkey try to steal something from you
Asia,We visited the monkey forest and is OK but beware the monkeys they will grab anything that is not tied down!
Asia,"Generally amazing trip, friendly monkeys, while thereâ€™s a rogue one bit me lol, thatâ€™s the one star less"
Asia,The Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary with its prime location within Ubud is quite different from the busy town outside its gates. This sanctuary and its inhabitants are well managed and maintained. The place seemed to calm the tourists down on their pace when entering it. It is time to observe the families of monkeys living their life with minimum interference from human been or other predators. The monkeys are well fed and look after with health clinic if needed. Do spend some quite moment to associate oneself with our closest relative in the animal kingdom. Plan minimum 1-2 hours wandering around the vast ground inside.
Asia,Not much else to tell you other than the highlight was a monkey getting aggressive.... Monkeys in a forest. If you have never seen a monkey or been in a forest then go.
Asia,"I suggest you to study a little bit Monkey s behavior and habits to avoid monkey attack.
The park is very nice and you will meet monkeys even in the street.
So funny... but if you don t control your behavior, the situation could turn unconfortable."
Asia,"When I was told the monkeys would come to you if you made eye contact, I know I would be the one. When we got off the taxi I carried my bag like normal but a monkey quickly tried to grab anything out of my bag. Nothing taken but could have been tshirts, wallet or phone"
Asia,"Forest, monkeys, temples, and water features! You cannot go wrong with monkeys, they are always entertaining. All under a cool forest canopy:)"
Asia,"The forest itself is beautiful with many statues, bridges and a waterfall.
The monkeys are awesome and slightly mischievous which made it an entertaining experience.
If you in Bali it is something I think you should do."
Asia,I enjoyed dropping into the monkey forest a word to first timers the monkeys are expert at geting food from you & hats & glasses so take care.
Asia,"We visited the Ubud Monkey Sanctuary in 2015, at the time when you could still buy bunches of bananas from vendors in the park and feed them to the monkeys. The monkeys were very aggressive, jumping on visitors, stealing things like phones and bags, and yelling and fighting. Back then it was a chaotic place.

I am happy to say that the sanctuary is now much more peaceful. They have done away with the vendors and have food in designated areas provided for the monkeys around the park. The experience now is much less stressful - the monkeys run around doing monkey things and only paying a little attention to the visitors. They will still occasionally jump on someone to try to grab a flashy object, but overall it was very chill and enjoyable."
Asia,"This place is so worth every cent you spend on admission, and it's not too expensive either. It's a giant sprawling expanse of protected money reserve. Not recommended for mobility impaired people, although there is a back entrance that is directly at the temple for those who cannot make the journey (but in my opinion that's the best part). My mother was surprised when a few monkeys hopped into her and tried to steal her purse and loot it by unzipping it hahaha. Be careful what you bring into the place and prepare to be up close to nature's tricksters!"
Asia,This place is good for all people. The place is huge surrounded with trees and monkeys!!! Many temples to visit and I like the wooden path and bridge the most.
Asia,l really had a great time here. Managed to get some amazing shots and l beat the crowds with an early morning arrival.
Asia,"If you like to see animals in their habitats you should definatley come here.
Monkeys are everywhere you can take photos and even touch them!"
Asia,"You should visit there,if you are in Bali. One of the good place where ib Ubud area. Walking distance. Experince for freely monkey leaving place.."
Asia,"Itâ€™s nice to walk among the monkeys and watch them tease each other from time to time. Follow the officers instructions and warnings carefully because monkeys, by their very nature, can steal what have in your hand and whatâ€™s in your bag very quickly"
Asia,Living among the people but they do have their own forest for it to. Still lots of people walking on their habitat.. Do not try to feed them or take food with you when entering..
Asia,"A beautiful park filled with monkeys. Lots of fun and photo opporutunity. A must visit when in Bali. Just keep your bags closed, secure your food and drinks beacuse some monkeys are little thiefs!"
Asia,Good place to visit ticket is around 60000 Indonesian .good to visit once. Guards are friendly.dont try to touch child monkeys.
Asia,"Great place - must visit ... cute little monkeys but unless you want be bitten donâ€™t give your own food. Follow the instructions mentioned in the park.
We saw an old Asian man bitten by monkey 3 times! â€œâ€horror movie... â€œâ€"
Asia,"If you love monkeys itâ€™s okay, to be honest I didnâ€™t find it that fascinating. Itâ€™s was just monkeys and yes the scenery is beautiful."
Asia,Very nice experience between the jungles and a monkeys if you are in Bali u have to do this. the backside if the kids are scared from monkeys and monkeys can also be sometimes a bit aggressive so no sunglasses no mobiles nothing outside the bags or outside the pocket
Asia,"A must to visit but watch over your belongings, some monkeys are really naughty and tend to steal things especially shiny objects and sometimes they tend to jump on people in order to achieve their theft."
Asia,"It was nice to walk around the monkeys without any fence or cages. My son was carrying some candies and that was the only time the monkeys tried to still something from us! Not allowed to touch or feed the monkeys, the guards are pretty strict about it! But some areas were closed so it was a downside the walk around was pretty short..."
Asia,It was well maintained and had a beautiful surrounding. There were people in-charge called as 'Monkey Officers' or 'Monkey Police' to ensure the safety of the tourists. did some wonderful purchase from the shops inside - be sure to bargain and get a good deal.
Asia,"Monkeys can be cute, from a distance :)

This is an amazing location to walk through a sanctuary full of free roaming monkeys.

You will be warned about taking loose items like sunglasses, bags, etc that can attract a monkey's attention, TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY !

We were pushing our son on a stroller with his lunch and a yellow packet of wet wipes tucked underneath. Within 30 seconds of venturing into the park, a monkey casually walks up to us and grabs the packet of wipes! We were stunned but relieved that he didn't come for our son or his lunch ...

Needless to say, we made our way out at haste but not before we managed to get some beautiful pictures of these super cute animals in their natural habitat...

I will take this opportunity to help out our guide over our stay. Pak Nyoman was our driver and guide for 4 days across different parts of the island. We were a family of 5 including 2 kids and were very comfortable in his clean and well maintained Toyota Avanza. He was always on time, his driving was very safe and his communication in English was very good. At all attractions that we visited, people seemed to know and respect him. He was also very helpful with advice regarding the do's and dont's at different places. I'd recommend his service any day. The gentleman is reachable on +6281241056489."
Asia,"I love monkeys and so loved this place!

If, like my other half, you are not a fan of monkeys, think twice before heading along.

The complex is large and clean and - as the name suggests - there are a huge number of free roaming monkeys. There are various designated eating areas for the monkeys so they by and large keep themselves to themselves. However, they are mischievous and unpredictable and we did witness a couple of them jumping on unsuspecting visitors and also rifling through wallets and handbags and stealing food and other items.

The grounds are very well maintained and include a number of temples and a river flowing through the large site. As above, if you like monkeys, this is a must. If not, enter with caution! The ticket price is more than reasonable and you can spend as long as you like in the venue..."
Asia,"Worth a visit. A lot of Crab Eating Macaques around, nice forest setting, we spent a good hour there. If youâ€™re in Ubud already pop in."
Asia,"The Sacred Monkey Forest in Ubud is a magical place, with over 1000 long tailed Balinese monkeys in 7 distinct groups and around 115 different species of trees in a verdant jungle, one can spend hours just watching the monkeys interact in their natural environment."
Asia,Its a funny place. Just in the center of Ubud. Very beautiful. Monkeys everywhere. Very well maintained. Must visit if you are with kids.
Asia,"To do: Two hours of visit of the sanctuary. Baby Monkies may be curious and come to you to look for food and water. It is highly recommanded to put glasses, hat and bottle of water inside your bag."
Asia,"Very nice experience - must visit in Ubud!
You can pay cash or cc at the entrance. Be careful with your water bottles - monkey can steal it!"
Asia,"Entrance fee is 80,000 per person, with free parking if you keep your ticket.
It's a really cool park/forest where monkeys roam free and where you'll have plenty of opportunities for cool Instagram worthy pictures (if that's your thing)"
Asia,"One of the most organized public places in Ubud.

Comfortable parking, spacious reception, quick ticketing process, clean and big toilet.
Delicious coffee at reception cafe (not included to the ticket).

The park itself large, with rich shadow made by greenery. A lot of funny monkeys around, live their monkey lifes and feel kings in this sacred place. vIt was very interesting to watch them.

Many park workers always are there if you need help from some brazen monkey wild attitude. So situation is safe and under supervision.

There are several temples and many statues across the park, together with fancy trees and long vines create a sense of fairy tales.

Will come back there again on my next trip."
Asia,A wonderful place to visit and get to see these creatures in a place set aside to ensure their survival. Seeing them up to their antics was a highlight. Also having an opportunity to see some of the sacred ceremonies in progress at the different temple sites was absolutely worth the visit. Amazing experience.
Asia,"This is relevant since we have an infant in a pushchair. Had to carry both most of the way around. Was nice to see the monkeys out loose, our boy enjoyed it (mosquitoes and humidity aside)."
Asia,"I recommend NOT carrying anything inside this place because the monkeys may try to take it from you. LOL
Overall, the place is very beautiful and has a naturalistic appearance despite the man-made additions. There are English written signs advising visitors what to do if a monkey climbs on them or HOW to act when in proximity to them. The grounds is in a circular pattern with 3 exits.
As we were walking on one of the paths, a monkey approach and climbed me because I had my purse hanging on my side. After climbing all over me to access my purse, he tried to take it from me. I pulled my purse away and that's when the monkey hissed at me. I let out a scream to ""encourage"" him to release my purse and get off of me. It worked! :) The same little monkey crawled on a guy, opened his bag, and took out a tissue and some other item. When the guy try to take it back, he hissed at him as well. Be careful when carrying or wearing anything loose, the monkeys are very quick!"
Asia,"Even if you do nothing else in Bali, go to see the monkeys! Amazing. For $8 entrance fee, it is sooo worth it. You only have to walk 10 meters and the monkeys are everywhere, even babies that are so cute. They are all cared for really well by the looks of it. There are keepers around every corner making sure that visitors are obeying the rules, which is great to see. You can walk at a leisurely pace and cover lots of ground. It really is an amazing experience. Enjoy!"
Asia,"Its a park/forest with pathways so you can not get lost unless you want to! Dont touch or feed the monkeys, couse the will take your stuff away!"
Asia,It was great visit!I want again!The best place for everyone to see the animals in their natural behavior.Must to visit!
Asia,This place was so huge and the monkeys were wild. The entrance fee would be 50k rupiah. It was a fun experience. Please make note that you are not allowed to have an eye to eye contact for this will be a sign of aggressiveness to them. Avoid wearing flashy clothes and jewelry as well and donâ€™t feed the monkeys.
Asia,"Entrance fee is 50k for an adult, worth it. You can walk around in 1,5hrs the monkeys are cute and entertaining. They wonâ€™t hurt you until you chase them. You just have to know the basic rules. No plastic or paper bags carried, donâ€™t feed them or take their food away and donâ€™t touch them then all will be ok."
Asia,"The Forest is not huge but they made it very nice for the monkeys. Be careful and donâ€™t take any food with you. Theyâ€™ll smell it ;) walk a round, take some cute pics and videos of the monkeys!"
Asia,Be careful as to not get too close to the monkeys. The greenery and vegetation is superb. Lots of opportunities to great photos
Asia,"It is not as dangerous as some wrote in their reviews. But yes, you should be careful when u visit the monkey forest. There are lots of monkeys and also the forest is quite well maintained. Please do not carry any snack or food items as the monkeys will come to take it. We took out a cupcake for my 3 year old and the monkey took it from him. It was funny but still children might get scared. Lot of pictures to take and a good walk around the forest. A must visit place !!"
Asia,So many monkeys around and they are very friendly. I usually am very scared of the monkey but these monkeys are so chilled and minding their own business and yea lots of colourful fishes.
Asia,"We watched many cute monkies, this forest has different types of trees with stairs inside for tourist walk plus rest and shop area.....its nice place too for photos"
Asia,"The forest is well kept and clean

Monkeys are used to play infront of humans
Entry ticket 20000 IRP around 2 dollars"
Asia,"Not expensive, nice area with lots of monkeys. You can walk there from Ubud easily (it's in town!). They seem pretty happy, but they will steal your hat or sunglasses if you're not careful! Worth a visit (you don't need long)."
Asia,"Good for a relaxed couple of hours if you visit Ubud. The monkeys seem accustomed to visitors and just go about their usual routine. We left our backpacks and handbags in the car based on previous reviews and it was a good decision. The
monkeys know how to open zippers and remove items! You are advised against carrying water insider but we saw quite a lot of people carrying water bottles.

It was quite humid when we visited and the only option of buying water/juices are by the reception (either before going in or post your visit). Also be mindful that the area has several steep steps which might be challenging for older people or people with weak joints!

Overall a unique experience and well worth the visit!"
Asia,A monkey sanctuary that the Balinese hold as sacred. This forest contains a large troupe of monkeys that have become accustomed to people and are not afraid to unburden you of your possessions in search of food
Asia,"Love the monkeys love the place love the way to there . Must visit if u are in ubud
Well organised. Beautiful forest happy place"
Asia,"monkeys everywhere, very entertaining. the park is pretty big.

you can get close to the monkeys and see them running around. some are trained to get close.
a good 2 hour slow stroll in the park
"
Asia,The most thing you have to do when arrived at Ubud. A lot of monkeys and were really cute! Best experience
Asia,One the best places you should go and see very nice and so green the monkey are so funny and you can get a really nice pictures there and have a very good time too
Asia,"Such a nice little scape in the middle of the chaos. Mind your small items (glasses, earrings, etc) because the monkeys will grab them and ask for a bribe (food)!"
Asia,"Amazing jungles and architecture. We have a good time with family.
Recommend for couples with kids.
Not so big place but nice.
As for temples all of them closed. But you can take a pictures through the gates.
"
Asia,The enviroment is green. The monkeys are crowd and brave. Take care of your things. Hahaha. You should come here at least one time.
Asia,"It was pretty fun and great to see everything in the forest. It didn't take us very long, and it was kind of crowded, but we had a fun time. We've seen monkeys other places so it may not have been worth it"
Asia,Overall fun and freaky to see all these monkies running around and sneaking up on you. Was safe but saw a few ladies carrying fancy bags get harassed. They should have just relaxed and not scream so much. Took about 30 mins to walk around but could probably spend an hour here. Being bug spray.
Asia,"One of the best things about this sanctuary is that the animals are in their natural dwelling. It does not appear zoo-like and the monkeys are abundant. We saw infants with their mothers, playful groups, mating rituals, grooming behaviors,and monkeys swimming in a little pond. There are no barriers and you are just among the animals in nature."
Asia,"Loved the experience. You can get up close to the monkeys but donâ€™t feed them, touch them or look them in the eyes. There are a list of rules so just do what they say. Many great photo opportunities"
Asia,"Visited here with my boyfriend...
Entrance fee very minimal to get in.
Loads of staff around to talk to ask very friendly.
Lots and lots of monkeys!
We spent a couple of hours there slow walking around there's quite a few stairs."
Asia,"We went right on opening time when there wasn't many people and it wasn't too hot. The carvings/statues are cool and there is lots of awesome photo opportunities.
Unfortunately after about 30 minutes, hoardes of people arrived and all photo opportunities were ruined. You can barely see anything as people are crowded around. The monkeys can be aggressive and will steal your stuff as well so be careful. Overall: average."
Asia,"There is nothing in this forest except
For tamed monkeys and bats. Entrance fees is there. Nothing great. Maybe avoided if possible. But generally taxis give a package for all three that is mengwi, monkey forest, and tanah lot as they are close by. Taxi start at 1pm and cover all three and bring you back by 8pm"
Asia,"A unique open zoo which are surround by seems to be trained monkeys.
They will never snatch any belongings, either disturbed you at any moment.
A most enjoyable garden specially for children. You can't imagine how much children can enjoy and pass a more than half of the day playing with the monkeys. If you been in Bali you must visit monkey forest in Ubud, as they believe a ""tri hita karma"" you will definitely match the how they harmony with the trained of human and breast."
Asia,"beautiful green forest, definitely worth visiting. but beware of the monkeys.
honestly i found them busy in their own world, hardly bothering the tourists. its only when tourists try to invade their space, take pictures, feed them (all of which is actually not allowed) they snatch stuffs.
so just leave them alone, and enjoy the beautiful walks all around the park"
Asia,"The most I like is the Down stream and sound of rushing water, natural bridges giant trees, absolutely mind blowing visual treat, u feel like I r at enter of a fence dark forest with lots of koi fish and monkeys"
Asia,"As the name suggests, one can find a variety of monkeys in this place. The place was quite crowded when we visited. Also, it was quite hot on the day. The place has a bit of walking to do. Though slightly tiring, this is a nice place to visit."
Asia,"Good experience, close interaction with monkeys, beautiful park and chance to get a monkey selfie.
Monkeys do try to play with you and come near to you and show their teeth especially if u r holding bag."
Asia,"A very well maintained tourist attraction in Ubud. Located right in the heart of the city. The staff is very friendly and will share tips to have a better visit. You will be asked to remove any sunglasses, earrings or sacrves and store everything in a singel bag. Water bottles will be stored at the gate. Be careful when using your phones or cameras while clicking pictures since the monkeys tend to get a bit notorious.
Avoid secluded paths or being alone if you are scared and do not scream or make loud noises if you are approached by a monkeys.

A good place and must visit when in Ubud."
Asia,I think you shouldnt leave ubud without visiting this place.monkeys are every where.there are lots of them.really cute and funny
Asia,Beautiful temples with monkeys running around all over the place:-) some beautiful scenery that is worth searching out. Reasonably priced as well
Asia,While visiting the forest one of the monkeys snatched our water bottle and opened our hand bag and threw our sun glass.luckily one of the tourists helped us in getting our hand bag back from the monkey.so don't go with water bottle and hand bags.
Asia,"Beautiful place to visit and have a good leisurely walk.

The place is well-maintained and it is wonderful to see monkeys in their lush habitat.
The instructions to follow are well written and made available throughout the place along with rather descriptive details of possible consequences.

It takes a while before you realize this verdant monkey habitat is in the middle of the city thanks to how well it has been planned and maintained.

You get to see monkeys in their grandeur across all ages from mischevious infant to the wise, thoughtful and ancient looking ones. It is common sight to see them climbing on to folks and trying to sniff for food. It is also a guilty pleasure watching folks freeze with fear at the sight or approach of a monkey.

There are also monkeys in captivity for ailments, old age and blindness. They appear well cared for and the blind monkey was well acquainted to the touch of tourists.

Visting this place feels like panacea of sort and would request folks to stick to the rules to make sure you don't have a hard time or give a hard time to the monkeys of the habitat. It was overall a wholesome experience and would strongly suggest everyone to visit it."
Asia,Enormous amount of money and of all family groups. Right from child to very old money has been encountered in this location. Inside there is some temples were we can see group of one famil monkeys. Very scary as they climb on you if u have some eatable items or they take your backpacks and open it. Be aware that u don't carry anything
Asia,"Thanks God. After 26 years finally I visited monkey forest .
Beautiful jungle with great temple inside.
Tickets is but expensive but it's worth it.
Lil bit scared with the monkeys but they are fine .
Me and my fiancee really enjoyed"
Asia,"Environment is green and peaceful. Situate in the centre of Ubud. Not far from other place. But take care your glass.

"
Asia,"This place was so beautiful! You should always note that these monkeys are wildlife animals and their behavior is sometimes hard predicted, but if you follow all the rules, everything will be fine."
Asia,"Monkeys everywhere! The staff are very helpful, overall, with aiding in getting photos with the monkeys. Don't bring any type of drink/ water bottle with you! I had one tucked in my purse, and was immediately pounced on. He wanted it, got lid off, and dumped it out... lol"
Asia,"I wasn't impressed, having seen lots of macaques elsewhere in Southeast Asia, but my girlfriend loved it. Touristy place and monkeys are used to having people around. They are fed very well, which means they won't try too hard to steal your food."
Asia,"We enjoyed our time here. The park is very close to the main area of the town, so it is easy to get to, and it is well-run and organized. We stayed at the Visesa resort and it was about 10 minutes by car from there. Ticketing is simple and smooth. We started in the late afternoon when it was a little cooler and when we finished, it was time for an early dinner at one of the many nice nearby restaurants. Walking around slowly taking photos it took us about an hour to see all the areas. We were surprised by the number of monkeys. There are many everywhere - in the trees, on the pathways, on the statues. The combination of monkeys, deep green jungle plants and huge mossy trees and structures was fun to experience."
Asia,"This forest is must go place!
It looks so magical and you could understand why Balinese has treated this forest specially once you visit here."
Asia,"Amazing nature mixed with great sculptures and local temples architecture. A lot of fun if you enjoy interacting with monkeys, but remember this are wild and might act in unexpected ways."
Australia,Walked around monkey forest today. Bring a water bottle. I also enjoyed art Gallery. lots Of tourists. Lots of stairs.
Australia,In our opinion a must do whilst in Ubud. The forest is luscious and green with a beautiful stream running through it. The monkeys are very interesting
Australia,"Nice visit and it was lovely to see all the baby monkeys . It's well managed by the staff so absolutely no feeding of the monkeys by tourists which is to protect and ensure the safety of them and the tourists.
Definitely worth a look ."
Australia,"You pay a fee to get in to the forest. Understandable as it would take a bit to upkeep the temples inside and look after the habitat surrounding.

Monkeys were being fed at different stations around the park by staff. There were plenty of staff around to make sure guests were safe and to warn people when they were doing things that may lead to being attacked by the monkeys.

Staff did make sure plastic bags and loose items were kept secured before entering.

Monkeys were great to watch and weren't too bothered by the amount of people. Some found interest in my bag, but were quick to scurry away when I pulled it away from them.

This was a good way to spend an afternoon after shopping in the markets."
Australia,"I was reticent to go to this place - was expecting monkeys to be caged and manipulated to interact - but was pleasantly surprised. A very well organised and easily accessible park - right on the edge of Ubud town - with plenty of parking.
Was very impressed with the layout of the park and how easy it is to see the monkeys.
Found it fascinating that there were so many monkeys of all types and sizes thronging around the park with no barriers. You do need to be cautious because they will grab bags etc but as long as you are vigilant it seemed fairly safe. One of the best tourist attractions I have seen anywhere in the world. It was enjoyable to just wander around at leisure and observe the behaviour of the various monkeys. Look forward to taking my grandchildren to visit one day - children would be awed and delighted to see monkeys up so close."
Australia,"Great price, awesome facilities & nicely maintained park. The trees are huge!! ðŸŒ´There are HEAPS of monkeys!!! They are pretty well behaved towards humans as they are well fed ðŸŒ just make sure you follow the rules! We saw a ladyâ€™s hat get stolen off her head!"
Australia,"Monkeys were well behaved, well fed and fascinating to watch with their antics. Very humid morning, but maps provided regularly for you to orientate yourself in the park."
Australia,"Visited in 2012. Wonderful wildlife.
Security keep out scammers.
A little expensive though fascinating"
Australia,"It's something to do. We weren't planning to go but it was on the way to the markets and we were walking. The monkeys are cheeky and they will climb on you. They will try to go through your bags but they are harmless. I had one climb on me with a baby clinging on. Cute, I thought until I discovered it had monkey poo on it's feet."
Australia,"A previous reviewer said it was â€œless scary than expectedâ€ my partner found it to be more scary than expected. She has previously seen a woman attacked by a screeching monkey in Thailand and she spent the whole time worried about making eye contact with some simian psychopath and provoking the same response. We went in about 250 yards, in that time we saw dozens of monkeys, because of her anxiety/nervousness we turned around and walked out. BUT we saw no one being attacked, we saw plenty of monkeys, if you want to see monkeys â€˜in the wildâ€™ (well, sort of) this was a guaranteed opportunity, not expensive and probably great for kids."
Australia,"It was very busy when we visited
today. There were monkeys doing the things that monkeys do.
Someone got bitten but he appeared to be deserving of this
Only $8 to get in but there is not a lot to do once youâ€™ve seen the monkeys"
Australia,"Visited monkey forest on our recent trip to Ubud. Entry free isnâ€™t to expensive, and they state most of the money goes towards looking after the monkeys and there surrounding habitat.

They have plenty of staff there, and if you do get in strife with the monkeys they are quick to help. We had no problems, we kept our distance got some great photos. We had a backpack on and didnâ€™t get hassled by the monkeys. Itâ€™s something great to do, for the family, I would recommend doing it."
Australia,"This is my second time after a few years absence and I noticed how much less aggressive the monkeys were. From what I can see this is because the monkeys are fed constantly by the keepers who are by the way so friendly and helpful. For those that want photos with a monkey they will orchestrate it in a safe manor. There was still the odd one that passed by a pocket and slid it's hand in to see if there was a food treat hidden although they will not reject a wallet!
If you follow the instructions on the signs you will have a fabulous visit. I could not get enough of the monkeys."
Australia,I really enjoyed the Monkey Forest. It is quite spread out so you can get away from the crowds and there are loads of monkeys everywhere. Beautiful forest and temples to walk around. The Monkey Forest is really central too so easy to find and get to.
Australia,"It's a good place to visit when you're in Ubud. The monkeys are not aggressive. It seems like they're already used to be around human. Just be careful not to make eye contact with them, since that will provoke the monkeys and don't make a sudden move when there's monkey close to you.
The sad thing is that the place was too crowded when I was there, so rather than monkey forest, it's more like tourists forest.
"
Australia,Such an amazing place for the monkeys to live & hang out. They are so entertaining to watch & keep you laughing at their antics. Beautiful place to visit & highly recommend it.
Australia,"I didnâ€™t expect the Sacred Monkey Forrest to be this much fun. Yes, itâ€™s busy and there are too many tourists, but that didnâ€™t take away from the fun of having all these cheeky cute monkeys around."
Australia,"Sure the amount of tourists will get to you.
Sure the monkeys are great but irritating after a while.
Yes itâ€™s 25 years since I was last here and seems a tad commercial.

However the view!!!! Stunning gardens. Just go and go with the flow.

If the amount of tourists and monkeys grate on you - go earlier when less people are around.

A must do while in UBud!"
Australia,"The monkey forest is beautiful and the monkeys are super cute, although I was a little disappointed to see as much rubbish in there as there was. For how many staff of keepers there were working in there youâ€™d think they would pick it up. I saw at least 3 monkeys playing with or chewing on plastic rubbish. But all in all a good experience as the monkeys are completely free and roam as they please which is awesome. Just donâ€™t wear bright coloured jewelry or take food in as theyâ€™ll try to get it off you!"
Australia,"Visited last year, loved it so much, came back this year and will probably come next year. It is so beautiful."
Australia,This is a must do in Ubud. If you want a photo just sit down near a monkey and you should get a great shot. The park is huge and incredibly beautiful. Ticket prices are reasonable
Australia,"Great day out and fun for all.
Monkeys are mischievous and funny to watch which makes the experience so entertaining. A must see when in Ubud."
Australia,Cheeky monkeys. Be sensible and you will enjoy. Follow the signs. Get close to nature in this wonderful place.
Australia,Over rated to be honest. Not sure where we went last time to Bali but monkeys jumped on you and you could take photos and feed them. The zoo keepers donâ€™t want them on you at all. Still a good day out for a walk through the rain forest. Wonâ€™t visit again though.
Australia,"This sanctuary would have to be one of my favourite places in Bali. A stop here was included in our day tour we had booked and we both loved it. Apart from being a stunningly beautiful place, the monkeys are so awesome. We got to watch them being fed and one took a liking to my husband for a short period of time, climbing on his shoulder. As long as you follow the guidelines for interaction with the animals itâ€™s perfectly safe and enjoyable place to visit for both young and old. Could have easily spent the whole day here watching the monkeys."
Australia,"If youâ€™re coming to Ubud you canâ€™t go past this stunning ancient forest which is just crawling with mischievous little monkeys.
Keep your possessions well secured as we observed them going through the handbags of distracted tourists and relieving them of their drink bottles.
The sights of the forest itself is quite magical. The fact itâ€™s home to the monkeys just adds to the mystique.

"
Australia,It was a lovely afternoon activity walking through the rainforest and there are lots of monkeys around.
Australia,"I wasnt overly fussed about coming here in the first place, but that is because I have been to a monkey forest back in the uk, and so have seen monkeys up close , walking about etc. With it being in Bali I didn't know what to expect, but I expected more than the UK which I don't think it was.

It was a nice place but I just expected more monkeys , just something more. I guess I felt a little unsafe as well, because previous people had told me they knew of someone who had been bitten, I didnt feel safe letting my little one walk about by herself, so we carried her around the whole time. We did watch one of the monkeys jump on a lady and bite her bag and try and bite through it.
She did really like seeing the monkeys walking about."
Australia,"We walked the monkey forest road and saw so many monkeys around we didnâ€™t even bother going inside to pay a fee. I personally wouldnâ€™t bother, just walk around outside, even around Ubud you will see them in the trees outside restaurants and warungs, plus it looks a bit like a tourist trap."
Australia,"Extremely well presented venue with lush gardens and lots and lots of cheeky monkeys. Be sure to follow the instructions and not take any food in, not even in your bag, otherwise the monkeys will think it is theirs for the taking.
Well maintained and entry fee is extremely reasonable.
Lovely way to spend a morning wandering through."
Australia,"Itâ€™s 80k to enter. They feed the monkeys so they come around. You wonâ€™t be short of them. Mums and babies were very cute.

Youâ€™ll need to hold onto your belongings. No hats or glasses or they could get stolen.

Youâ€™re not supposed to feed them. I think if you did they might jump on you. Iâ€™d be careful if you were going to do that.

Itâ€™s fun for 1-2 hours."
Australia,Have seen more than my fair share of monkeys however these were reasonably friendly as long as you adhere to the rules which are posted on large notice boards. I sat quietly on the edge of a path during feeding time and had two lovely encounters with juvenile monkeys climbing on me. Very safe and very cute.
Australia,"Lots of monkeys and as we went at around midday they were being fed by the staff, they were easy to see. No feeding by the public is allowed any more, unlike it used to be many years ago. Better for the public safety and monkey diet.
No problems with monkeys on the day we were there with climbing onto people or stealing sunglasses etc.

"
Australia,".. on Monkey Forest Road and they looked very content and healthy. One was on a lampost at head height and I passed within about 0.3m and didn't feel afraid at all, unlike in India. Good place."
Australia,"We have visited monkey forest many times over the years and have always thoroughly enjoyed watching these fascinating animals. The grounds are very well kept with a lot of staff wandering around cleaning and keeping an eye on things. This time how ever was alittle disturbing, I saw 2 ladies get bitten by
monkeys within minutes of each other. They were extremely aggressive this time round so I shall never go back to monkey forest again."
Australia,"We walked to monkey forest from our resort in Ubud. Lovely,green lush gardens. The monkeys seem happy and lots of babies. The staff seem to feed and care for them very well"
Australia,"Great open area with some local religious sites and great carved stone walls depicting the mischevious monkey god. The monkeys roam freely and are well cared for, the sanctuary entry fee supports the maintenance of the Sanctuary and also the local community. This is one of the more expensive tickets in Bali but you can see the money is used well. Also saw some overseas student conducting some behavioural studies of the interactions of the different monkey clans that occupy the park. Very interesting."
Australia,"We visited and had our credit card declined twice. Payed cash. The two declined transactions were then approved over 24 hours later. The women on the counter did not (or pretended to not) understand my requests for a receipt. Thank goodness for a local SIM card and Skype to speak to our credit card company back home. Will have to wait 21 days to see how this turns out, but not worth the hours of hassle to sort out.

Also a monkey jumped on and scratched one of our children. She was doing nothing to attract or anger it. The first aid provided by the centre was good. The monkeys can carry some nasty diseases. On reflection I don't think the experience is worth exposing children to this risk. There are monkeys elsewhere in Bali that are not as overfed and semi-domesticated."
Australia,"This is a must-see for any visitor. I donâ€™t exactly love monkeys (think they are shifty little thieves), but the forest walk among old temples and other buildings is stunning. Itâ€™s nice and cool, so good for hot days, and you will guaranteed see more monkeys than you can poke a stick at.
Donâ€™t take any food, water bottles, paper or plastic bags with you, because they will 100% be very interesting to the monkeys.
There is also a cafe with light refreshments and plenty of seats."
Australia,Unless youâ€™re really into monkeys I wouldnâ€™t bother with this one - not expensive but not much to do other than walk around the tropical gardens and try and not have a close encounter - you are told not to look at the monkeys in the eyes so that makes it a bit stressful - they run around in Front and over you and fight each other - would not even consider going in the humid months unless you love that weather
Australia,"I am a little freaked out by monkeys, they are so unpredictable. But they were all pretty chill here. And the actual forest is so beautiful. Loved it!"
Australia,"Good fun for $8 per person.
Monkeys everywhere and lots of staff, so you are safe.
The monkeys are fed all round the walkways so they donâ€™t pester you like they used to.
"
Australia,"Beautiful place, but you need to take care with the sunglasses and bags, because the monkeys can steal it."
Australia,Absolutely worth the visit!! I had a monkey jump on my shoulders as soon as we entered but I kept walking and it jumped straight off! Beautiful nature at its best ðŸ’•ðŸ™
Australia,"
Amazing forest filled with monkeys. One of the best tourist attractions I've been to. Hundres of cute monkeys as well as really beautiful nature. Takes easily few hours to go around the forest. A lot of walking but it's worth it. Forest blocks the sun, so it's not that hot in the summerâ¤ï¸"
Australia,"If being up close and personal with monkeys is your thing then this place is a must see. The monkeys are well fed to deter them from jumping on people and stealing your hats, bags or whatever else is loose on you ðŸ˜‰. At the end of the day they are a wild animal and my advice would be to give them their space."
Australia,"If you're afraid of monkeys do not come here because they do come right up to you, however, they are quite gentle and adorable. Word of advice: don't keep anything in the side pockets of your backpack. Well worth a visit even if you're not keen on monkey as it's a beautiful park."
Australia,If you love animals and especially cheeky monkeys then this is the place for you. I loved the fact that they roamed free and if you sat down or stood still long enough they would come to you. Such inquisitive creatires especially the young ones. I had three little babies climbing over me at one time and l loved every minute of it. The larger older ones could be a little intimidating. I could have sat and watched them all day.
Australia,"This is a gorgeaus forest with a lot of monkeys who like to eat and play in front of you.
The entry is $80 and the walk is very beautiful and interesting.
Be careful to monkeys, dont look at them in their eyes and donâ€™t joke with them.
Always find a security if you want to take a selfie with them! They will feed them and it looks like the monkey is taking the picture!!"
Australia,What was going to be an hours advenutrue turned into 4!did not want to leave. They are incredible to watch and had a great morning ðŸ’•ðŸ’
Australia,Such a fun experience seeing all the monkeys - keep your hats and sunglasses close though they run off with them in a flash!
Australia,"The monkeys forest was incredible, as long as you keep your witts about you! Over 1000 monkeys live in the forest for us to visit. The monkeys are so beautiful to watch and very patient with the crowds. There are always attendants nearby keeping watch for any people annoying the monkeys. You shouldnâ€™t take any food items into the forest, nor wear accessories as the monkeys may take these. It was gorgeous to watch the monkeys play, swing and eat. Iâ€™d definitely go again."
Australia,"Lovely place to visit with the lower walking trails a cool tropical jungle setting away from the heat and humidity at street level.
Cute monkeys.
Only distraction the amount of ""western"" rubbish (hand sanitizer, sunscreen tubes, water bottles) that thoughtless western tourists leave readily accessible despite warning signs in all languages."
Australia,Itâ€™s a cute way to spend an hour but donâ€™t know if Iâ€™d ever do it again. I went in the middle of the day - would reccomend going first thing to avoid the big crowds
Australia,"I love Monkey Forest, while there are other places where monkeys are either more aggressive or dirty, here they seem to be well fed and cared for and you can walk around a beautiful park and enjoy the experience but still still take precautions - follow simple rules like pack your shiny/bright items in your backpack, hold onto your camera & phone."
Australia,"There are load of monkeys and with staff feeding them regularly;y they are easy to see up close. The staff clearly look after them and the walk around the sanctuary is leafy, green and cool (and eaily managed at just about any fitness level)"
Australia,"interesting place but do not carry and bags ,especially plastic bags the monkeys will take all.
They are very cute from distance"
Australia,"while walking by the monkey forest the monkeys are everywhere so no need to go inside
spend some time for a similar view
but dont touch the monkey's ðŸ˜"
Australia,"The monkey forest is a must see. Itâ€™s a beautiful walk, mostly under the canopy of trees. The monkeys arenâ€™t aggressive, if you keep your distance they will too.
But if you take a seat near some monkeys, they will sit on your head and investigate you ðŸ˜‚
You can take a pram, thereâ€™s a ramp and everything is nice and smooth for the pram. Itâ€™s a long walk so I wish we had done this!
"
Australia,this place offers a nice short walk in a scenic place together with watching monkeys jumping around.
Australia,"Great sanctuary for monkeys in a large and lush area. We enjoyed the few hours at the sanctuary we spent there until a guy sitting next to us started patting a baby monkey, though the baby didn't mind, mum did and ran at the guy from behind and bit him in the back, the guy jumped up and people started to move out of the area quickly but my girlfriend was next to the baby patter so the mother monkey jumped on her leg and tried to bite her, fortunately my gf pushed the monkey down with a flat hand and only got a small bite on her finger which wasn't deep. This was seen to by the nurse at the sanctuary was cleaned. Just beware that even though you aren't doing anything wrong, there is still a risk you might get bitten. Just don't pat the monkeys is a great start."
Australia,"We visited the Monkey Forest with a toddler. It was only AUD$8 Each Adult Toddler was free.

It was a great experience however access was limited for prams and strollers. We could navigate the stairs with a small stroller but with a lot of effort. You can still get along way in but will need to navigate stairs if you want to see the picturesque old bridge and vines down at the river worth a look if visiting.

You will also see some big temples and amphitheatre within the park.

If worried about monkeys just keep distance. There are staff onsite that looked to be monitoring visitors and monkeys movements during our walk through. They were also feeding the monkeys at specific stations. No monkeys were jumping on people like Iâ€™ve seen in photos. I think that is something if the past that has been stopped.

Great experience recommended for everyone including families with young children.

"
Australia,"A lot more enjoyable than expected. Iâ€™d heard some negative stories about the monkeys, but they kept to themselves and we had no issues. Make sure you walk down the stairs to discover the lovely rainforest areas. Highly recommended."
Australia,"I was hesitant to take my 2.5 year old daughter here but Iâ€™m glad we did. She loved it.

As long as you donâ€™t disturb the monkeys (I took a selfie and one snarled at me) then you will enjoy this.

We only stayed about 20 minutes but that was long enough to enjoy the experience."
Australia,We went there thirty years ago and the area is cleaner and more professionally organised with manicured gardens on the way in. As adults we didnâ€™t need a long time here but it was a lovely place to walk in and cooler than outside. Keep an eye on cameras and possessions. A boy was bitten and a lady had a monkey jump on her head. They are confident monkeys so give them space.
Australia,"This is the best Monkey forest in Bali. Great for everyone. Very well looked after monkeys.
Lovely place to stroll around while being amongst the monkeys."
Australia,"We visited this place almost 20 years ago, and so much has changed!! There is paths now, no rubbish, lots of park rangers (if you call them that), and the monkeys seem quite friendly now!!
We read all this info on the web about putting away sunglasses and phones etc, however when we got there, lots of ppl were wearing sunnies on their head, phones out everywhere taking photos, etc!!
The rangers are always watching to ensure a safe trip, and certainly will tell off any person if they are doing the wrong thing!! (And we saw that happen!!)
Lovely place to visit, well worth the trip as ubud is also a lovely place, again lots changing since we were there!!"
Australia,I really thought this visit would be a let down. I'm pleased to say the day was enjoyable. Follow the rules about interacting with the monkeys. They are professional pick pockets. Take your time and stroll around. The gardens are just as enjoyable. Something worth doing on a day trip to Ubud.
Australia,"We visited with a big family, including 3yr olds and 70yr olds.
Everyone enjoyed the visit.
We were on a tour and didnâ€™t get to spend enough time but it was interesting."
Australia,"Monkeys everywhere, wouldnâ€™t be going back in a hurry they had most of it closed off for a religious ceremony so we didnâ€™t get to see the temples etc , but it was cheap so didnâ€™t expect much more to be honest!"
Australia,"Very impressed with the newly upgraded monkey forest. A great new entrance, more attendants and definitely safer. Still some idiots around that try to get the monkeys to climb on them, but we enjoyed it more than other times we have been."
Australia,"Itâ€™s so lovely to see the monkeys in a natural habitat and allowed to roam free. The grounds are beautiful and itâ€™s easy to forget youâ€™re in the middle of bustling Ubud.

We had our two year old with us and the monkeys completely ignored her.

Follow all the rules and youâ€™ll be fine!"
Australia,We visited the Monkey Forest at Ubud with our family. There were many very active monkeys & squirrels all over the park. The monkeys are quite cheeky & not at all timid. Again the staff/locals were very friendly & made our visit that much better.
Australia,"When visiting Ubud the Monkey Forrest Sanctuary should be on you checklist to visit.

Itâ€™s easy to get to and reasonably priced to enter ($AU10 per Adult)

The grounds itself is lush and green with lots of different pathways and structures.

Amazing greenery every and loads of photo opportunities and of-course loads of cheeky Monkeys.

The whole family will love this place, itâ€™s also shady, cool and very relaxing"
Australia,"We enjoyed out time in the monkey forest. The monkeys know how to open zips. One stole our hand gel. Another jumped on my husband and would not leave until she had checked all of his pockets. She then jumped on me - no pockets but she gently checked my top just in case. She was very light and for the most part, happy. When my husband offloaded her onto a seat she was not happy. She bared her teeth and hissed but nothing more. It is very important not to panic. One woman screamed when a monkey jumped on her. The monkey then jumped on her 4 yr old boy. She hit the monkey who then scratched the child as she tried to hang on. I guess he had to have a rabies shot."
Australia,"Well done way to see monkeys in theâ€wildâ€. That is, they free range around the sanctuary. Lovely walkways and views to see monkeys and forrest. Cheap visit for families. You really do have to watch that you donâ€™t take any food or even plastics as the monkeys will climb on you and try to steal things. My husband had his glasses taken out of his pocket."
Australia,"Such an amazing experience, the monkeys are so happy going about their day.

Watch them interact with each other, eat bananas and watch humans as we all walk around.

Make sure you don't wear a hat, sunglasses or have any food as the monkeys will take these away."
Australia,"A quick visit where we were surrounded by monkeys in a beautiful setting. We arrived at feeding time and their antics did not disappoint, if not a little cheeky. We could have spent so much longer there but we only arrived an hour before closing. Just remember don't have sunglasses on your head unless you don't mind them being stolen by the monkeys!"
Australia,"Had a great time at the Monkey Forest, really fun watching them interact with each other. Beautiful scenery even without the monkeys, a really beautiful place. Make sure you read the signage upon entry, seen a few monkeys going through peoples bags to get food of people that didnâ€™t follow the rules. Highly recommended"
Australia,We feel that there needs to be some changes to Monkey Forest as the monkeys are becoming too aggressive
Australia,"Ethically the Monkey Forest appeared to tick my boxes because there arenâ€™t any cages. But I saw monkeys eating someoneâ€™s chocolate (with foil), another steal prawn crackers and eat them, ive seen a photo of one earring a cornetto ice cream. I was looking at the Monkey temple and was horrified to see a huge dead monkey laying between the notice board & temple wall half covered with a black garbage bag (I wonâ€™t post photos which I have). I also saw a handler sling shot near the monkeys to direct/contain them? It felt totally tainted and overrun by tourists (like me) and the vibe was not right for me. It actually made me sad. I know the income is really important but something felt wrong here and I wonâ€™t be going back,"
Australia,"I initially wasnâ€™t keen to visit here, but my husband talked me into it.
The gardens and natural environment are beautiful. You donâ€™t have to get close to the monkeys if you donâ€™t want to.
We went here with a driver/tour guide who was very informative.
Donâ€™t take a water bottle inside - apparently this attracts the monkeys.
Definitely worth a visit!"
Australia,"Love it, love it, loved it!
Follow the recommendations and don't look the monkeys in the eye or take items that can be pinched.
So many monkeys of different species and they are relaxed in our presence, though still conform to their usual hierarchical systems and animal instincts. One lady had her pearl like earing taken off her ear.
Beautiful surrounds and an extremely affordable entry fee that was about Au $8."
Australia,Very enjoyable. Monkeys are fascinating to watch interact with each other. Free to roam around in an impressive Natural Jungle environment. Lots of different paths to take
Australia,"This is definitely one of a must visit on your Bali visit list. With amazing view everywhere you walk and most of all, the monkeys always seem to entertain ðŸ’ðŸ˜ðŸ’¯ðŸ™ŒðŸ™"
Australia,"Had a great time wandering the forest checking out the monkeys. If your not a keen walker you can still go around top of Forrest with out going down all the stairs to see the monkeys.
The baby ones are so cute."
Australia,Wow. This place has changed since I came here 25 years ago. The experience now is more about a walk around the temple in the immaculately kept gardens where you are able to view the monkeys without having any contact. My family and I went to the Sangeh Monkey Forest a few days previously. If you want to interact with the monkeys this is a better option.
Australia,Well maintained facilities with broad walkways and plenty of rangers on ground to ensure everyone respects the monkeys (do not try and touch them). Plenty of monkeys with all ages on display - babies very active and cute. Natural environment with monkeys obviously very happy to stay and interact with visitors
Australia,Interesting and funny seeing the monkeys in their own forest. Baby monkeys and their mums just so gorgeous. Beautiful gardens plenty of photo opportunities.
Australia,"I have visited here a few times but this time they have changed things around and it seems for the better. You are charged around AU$8 to get in and they no longer sell bananas for you to feed the monkeys. They now have the ""attendants"" at feeding stations and they cut up sweet potato and throw the occasional banana at the monkeys for you to watch. This avoids monkeys climbing all over people and it is much safer. They monkeys will still get on you if they see something they like (plastic bag, open pocket etc) and they are remarkably clever at finding these! Just follow the guidelines they suggest and you will be fine. There were lots of baby monkeys on this visit and it was really nice. Safe for families and smaller children. Treat them with respect and they will do the same for you!"
Australia,"A definite must when visiting Bali. We are able to be a guest in the monkeys' home which is a huge forest environment. Around 1000 monkeys live here in a natural environment. They are comfortable with people and curious with bags etc that we carry, so beware! We are not permitted to feed them but if they sense you have something that may resemble food they will attempt to procure it!!
If you are bitten, it is advisable to seek medical attention at the first aid clinic on the premises.
Great experience, more preferable to seeing these animals in cages!"
Australia,Obviously we went there to see monkeys but we didnâ€™t expect to see such magnificent trees which was an added pleasure. The monkeys arenâ€™t in cages and other then a few typical idiot tourists trying to coax the monkeys for their Instagram shots we were able to sit and we enjoy watching the monkeys do their thing. Lots of little babies playing to make your heart melt and the feeding tank structure was really interesting. We went on a Saturday and it wasnâ€™t even that busy.
Australia,"We loved the monkey sanctuary I highly recommend it.

Lots of stairs in some sections but plenty of places to stop and rest and look around."
Australia,"After being very hesitant to visit the monkey forest after what we had read, we are so glad we did. What a beautiful and peaceful place. Had no issues with the monkeys as they are well cared for and feed. Definitely a must do in Ubud."
Australia,"We werenâ€™t going to visit here due to reports of monkeys taking things and bitting, but on our travels it was recommended to go by an English girl. Glad we did! Great facility- clean and Iâ€™m pretty sure only stupid people get bitten ðŸ¤”ðŸ˜‰"
Australia,Very cheeky monkeys. Hold on to your belongings. Worth a visit. Kids will love the monkeys. Lots to see in Ubud.
Australia,"Firstly, be sure to follow rules strictly. I saw a monkey trying to grab things from someoneâ€™s pocket and I was curious what happened next, then the monkey saw me staring at him and got angry on me that he was trying to attack me. I wasnâ€™t mean to stare at him but remember: DO NOT STARE AT MONKEYS INTO EYES AND KEEP CALM ALL THE TIME. luckily my tour dragged me away and I got no hurt.
It was a really fun place that we can watch monkeys eating and fighting. Just a bit crowded because itâ€™s a really popular place to go.
As long as follow rules, I think itâ€™s nothing too worried."
Australia,"Every time we visit Bali I make sure we always come for a visit to the Monkey Forest. Over the last 10 years the entrance points have certainly improved. Make sure your guide if your on a tour takes you to the main entrance which has been renovated to include western standard toilets which do not cost to use, a small cafe serving cold drinks and juices and plenty shade to rest.
Walking through the jungle alone is beautiful with plenty of temples and statues to look at but seeing all the wild monkeys roaming free is just incredible and exciting to watch. There is always plenty of babies as well making mischief.
Ensure you give them space and you will be fine."
Australia,"Is a lot of fun watching and exploring the area as the monkeys interact amongst themselves and the interaction with ppl. Make sure nothing is able to be grabbed and taken by the monkeys as it happens so quick
"
Australia,"Our driver Made from Big Made Bali Tours took us here and explained everything, very surprising temples, gardens and monkeys."
Australia,"I visited having done little background reading and frankly wasn't expecting too much. Instead, I found this forest area to be really beautiful (and surreal in various areas) and obviously filled with many macaque monkeys. They were fascinating to watch. Very dynamic animals roaming about in a natural habitat. The area is quite large and between the beauty of the forrest and the entertainment provided by the monkeys, I could spend many hours here. We spent around 2.5 hours and our two young boys enjoyed it as well. They were a little jumpy as the monkeys can jump on you. Have to be careful as they like to take things as well, such as earrings. We had a number of occasions where monkeys decided to mate directly in our path, and that had my kids in fits of laughter. Great. Overall, highly recommended. Great place to visit. Very attentive keepers there too making sure the monkey-human interactions don't get out of hand."
Australia,Monkeys literally everywhere! Rangers are great and definitely help with keeping the very clever monkeys from getting out of hand. Pity the rangers canâ€™t do the same with the negligent tourists who give the monkeys human food and drinks all for the sake of a pic ðŸ™„
Australia,I loved watching the monkeys run around the Forrest. And the area itself is so pretty. I didnâ€™t have any problems with monkeys and I didnâ€™t see anyone else have problems either. One monkey jumped on someone but they just took a pic and then it jumped off. I would have loved to spend more time just watching the monkeys do their thing.
Australia,Small forested area near the busy shopping area of Ubud. There is an abundance of monkeys both inside and outside the gated park area. The park area is well maintained and has ample photo opportunities. Definitely worth a visit when you are in Ubud. Take advice from the guides and remove any food from your bags and keep them zipped as the monkeys are adept at pick pocketing and will not hesitate to grab your belongings.
Australia,"Been 4 times , each time monkey's seem to be a bit more aggressive, lost it's excitement I guess. If you've never done it , worth doing for sure."
Australia,Itâ€™s a tick off thing to do but wouldnâ€™t go again. The people working through the forest are very good. A young lady had a large monkey jump on her and he was there in seconds to help.
Australia,A must see if youâ€™re in Ubud. The monkeys are everywhere and incredible to watch. I highly recommend if you wanna spend a morning doing something.
Australia,"A relaxed beautiful sanctuary with ancient temples and happy monkeys
A photographerâ€™s delight with curious monkeys posing for close up shots
Highly enjoyable"
Australia,Monkeys are aggressive and horrible. They steal your stuff and food. I didn't like it at all but each to their own.
Australia,Loved it and loved the monkeys lol it was a blessing being there. Thank you for offering such a educational tour.
Australia,"I advise venturing past the main entrances, where many tourists tend to congregate, for the obligatory photos of feeding monkeys bananas and allowing them on to their shoulders, with attendants carefully monitoring the monkeys' behavior.
Walking around the gorgeous forest perimeter you can watch the antics of these clever creatures without engaging with them. Not making prolonged, direct eye contact or flashing your teeth at them, will minimise the chances of them becoming aggressive towards you. They are super fast and crafty if they want to steal from you, so don't carry any food on you and be on your guard to protect your belongings.:) Just remember, they are wild, fascinating animals and deserve respect in their own environment"
Australia,So many monkeys i could have sat all day and watched their antics. Would definitely recommend going.
Australia,Make the trip they are amazing to watch. Make sure not to wear jewellery and donâ€™t stash food or you will get more attention than you know what to do with
Australia,"I've been to ubud many times and have always been hesitant to go to monkey Forrest. I had imagined aggressive and large monkeys, like I had seen at uluwatu. Finally bit the bullet and went. It is a beautiful place and the monkeys are not aggressive at all. Ubud town have done a great job keeping the area accessible and clean, and looking after the natural habitat. I went back again the next day to explore more by myself and just sit and watched the monkeys playing, etc. Lovely green space and forrest."
Australia,It was nice to visit but to be honest I was scared of the monkeys. The babies are cute but two adult males started a fight in front of us barring their teeth.. so I got pas them quickly. It was all fine and we had a nice day out but I was on edge a bit.. my personality.
Australia,"A return trip after 27 (or so) years....So much has changed. I took my daughter (her first visit to Bali) and she loved it! So many monkeys and so, so many tiny babies! We could sit and watch their antics all day. Of course there is always that one person who ignores the whole â€˜DONâ€™T BRING FOODâ€™ signs posted everywhere ðŸ˜¡
Please read the signs before entering and adhere to them!"
Australia,"Picked up by our driver, PUTU, from Online Bali Driver, we had an excellent day visiting the monkey forest, butterfly sanctuary, elephant cave and a quick stop at a woodcarving place. Putu was very knowledgeable and his english was excellent. He was very good and would recommend him"
Australia,Great place to visit for an hour. Be sure to walk down where the water runs through for some excellent pics. Look out for the cheeky monkeys when wearing a backpack. Smart monkey almost ripped through our zipper to grab some cash hehehe. Enjoy and be respectful of their environment. Peace
Australia,"Such a fantastic place, really well maintained grounds and so many monkey, temples, waterfall and interesting things to see."
Australia,"Had a great time visiting monkeys, they are so funny. Local man helped us feed monkeys and he was very knowledgeable"
Australia,"I was expecting a very busy place with couple of monkeys but it was totally different. The Parc is quite big, so you can easily be out of the other people. And you get to see monkeys in their life, mainly eating or playing. The guard are here to help if there is any problem and are really helpful."
Australia,"We abided by the rules - no food, donâ€™t look into their eyes, donâ€™t touch, etc. we were only in there about 2 minutes and i got bitten by one while another tried chewing my trainer. It was a deep bite and drew blood. All I had done was point down the path with the tourist leaflet - and this was enough the provoke the attack. I immediately went to the first aid and the nurse cleaned the wound and dressed it but assured me they didnâ€™t have rabies. Of course the WHO, my travel insurance and Sydney public health all recommended rabies shots and B virus tablets. Thatâ€™s all under control but couldnâ€™t go in the pool or the sea or drink for the rest of my holiday.
Would not recommend a trip to the monkey forest - the monkeys are horrid and the whole experience put dampeners on my first holiday to Bali."
Australia,"The park itself was quite big and filled with great decor. Monkeys are everywhere and itâ€™s quite scary thinking what they might do to you. I saw a monkey jump on a gentleman, open his backpack, and take his tissues."
Australia,"Well behaved monkeys here, happy and well fed, was great to watch them having morning tea, the wee babies were so cute"
Australia,We took our 3 year old granddaughter who was delighted by their antics. However we made sure not to get too close. They will steal anything they can. Donâ€™t go in with food even if itâ€™s in a backpack. My friend had a monkey jump on his back unzip the backpack and start throwing everything out searching for treasure.
Australia,"Husband loved it, I tried but I am scared of monkeys and they are everywhere! Be warned they are very friendly and may look to jump on you."
Australia,"Who doesnâ€™t like walks with cute but dangerous monkeys creeping up behind, above, below and from every other direction.
Was really stunning spot to chill out and get away from the craziness and noise of Bali and this is despite all the tourists doing ridiculous poses for what I imagine could only be explained for Instagram ratings.
But please take note of the warnings on entrance into this place, they are definitely no joke. Saw someone being attacked by a monkey because she didnâ€™t act and was too worried about attempting to get a selfie ...very silly and I hope her hair grows back.
But no need to be overly worried there are park staff all over keeping an eye on the monkeys and visitors.
Also were some gift shops to stock up in case your having withdrawals of not shopping."
Australia,"This is a walk of harassment with monkeys literally jumping all over you, grabbing your things to try and get food.
A bit disappointing"
Australia,"You could spend an hour or two in this sanctuary. It depends how much you like monkeys or how interested you are in their habitat. I only needed an hour, enjoyed the green forest away from busy Ubud streets. You can see a monkey or two in the street outside the sanctuary."
Australia,"Stepping into this unique area of Ubud is like stepping into another world in a sense. The home of monkeys where we are just visiting and you get the feeling that you are there for their amusement! It is quite extraordinary to see so many monkeys, all shapes and sizes, though mostly quite small. Don't be surprised if they jump on you, but be careful of your bags, cameras, sunglasses etc, as they like to play and can run off with things!! You can see whole families, mothers suckling and playing with their babies. You do not have to go looking to see them - they are everywhere.
For anyone afraid of monkeys, this is not the place for you, but otherwise, for something unique, this is well worth a visit."
Australia,Pleasantly surprised how much I liked this sanctuary. The monkeys looked well cared for and had a huge natural area to live in. Well signed rules to protect the monkeys. Reasonable entry cost. It is an easy walk from central Ubud.
Australia,"Regard i don't take advise or others review any serious about the monkey would snatch your goods or the wildness of the monkey and insist to take my family (grandma 80yo and young child 3yo)
The experience was pleasant at the early stage where my little one enjoying watching the monkey and we spent about 30mins there and descided to leave.
So on our way out to exit from gate 1, one of the monkey was trying to grab my girl shoes (my dad was crying her) but couldn't then walk at the back of them my grandma had a shawl on shoulder. The monkey grab it and my grandma spontaneous pull back and the monkey was angry and bite her on her arm. It was bruise and bleed...one of the staff saw but prefer to ignore instead of approach to offer any help. We then reported to another staff who then took us to first aid booth and being reassure the monkey is clean and no tetanus or antirabis vaccine is require.....
I am not sure if i would like to risk it again in future.... but thank you to staff that took us to first aid booth and the staff that help!"
Australia,"Though we go to Ubud just about every year we have not been for about 30 years to the Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary.
Last year they put in a transport hub next to it and there are rice fields on the other side thus taking a lot of cars, bikes and busâ€™s off the side of the road, the area is a credit to the officials of Ubud, so being impressed with this area we decided to actually pay and go into the Monkey forest again. We would have spent a couple of hours in the Forest and it is really worth the visit especially if you have not been for a long time like us. Where you buy your tickets at the Transport Hub there are good clean Toilets, somewhere to buy something light to eat and drink.
There is plenty of signage in particular about the monkeys. Go and enjoy yourselves."
Australia,"Last time I visited 2 years ago you were able to interact with monkeys, sit and let them climb over you, you were also able to buy food on-site to feed them, this has now changed, you can only look and take photos. Not allowed to feed or let them climb on you,. Also there doesn't seem to be as many monkeys anymore"
Australia,"So cheap to get into for a main attraction, the entrance line goes down very quickly. The forest itâ€™s self is beautiful and the monkeys are everywhere, and very entertaining. We watched quite a few people get caught out with NOT following the rules and their possessions got taken by the inquisitive monkeys. Lots of staff around to help and we got some great pictures."
Australia,"Well maintained forest and beautiful natural habitat for the monkeys to freely roam about. IDR 800,000 entry fee per adult (May 2019). Wonderful place to see the monkeys lazing around, playing, grooming and eating. There are rules to go by when visiting that are aimed at respecting the monkeys and keeping you protected from any cheeky monkeys."
Australia,"Travelling with friends who haven't been to Bali before we thought we would just go to the carpark at the bottom of the road, see a monkey and leave. Our driver took us in through a formal entrance with the office and facilities surrounded by water with fabulous coloured coy fish. 80K IDRup for 1 adult and then we wandered. I don't like monkeys, they scare the heeebeees out of me but it was a lovely morning. The trees, plants, sculptures, the temple, the sound of the river and yes the monkeys were all great. There are 4 rules to follow, don't make eye contact, don't try and touch etc and lots of staff on duty to keep both people and monkeys safe. At one point 2 of the staff started making 'monkey call' noises. We just stood and watched as monkeys appeared from over at the shops, and from other parts of the forest heading to the calls. There were so many mums with their babies walking past us, it was fantastic. In all the times I have come to Bali this is the first I have gone right in to the forest (due to fear) it was great and even if you are scared of monkeys, go, follow the rules and just take it slow where you feel the need."
Australia,"The forest is beautiful. But the monkeys are mischievous and scary. The start of the walk was good and it seemed that the monkeys kept to themselves but as you reach near temple the monkeys starting jumping on people. One I saw two monkeys jump of her head and started gnawing her hair. I was shaken so did not want to continue looking around.

I didnâ€™t see any forest helpers trying to help this lady and many of the monkeys in this area were jumping on people.

Whilst I was waiting for my partner, I saw one monkey scratch a man.

If you are not scared of the monkeys and how unpredictable they can be then this would be fine. The forest is very clean and beautiful."
Australia,"Good pace to go for a walk and enjoy looking at funny monkeys . Park is pretty big , a lot of â€œ security â€œ that looks after monkeys . They donâ€™t attack people , just live in their home nature ."
Australia,"This place is amazing with over 800 monkey,s just roaming around in an unfenced environment. It,s a lovely cool tree forest where you can take a break from the heat and just laugh at the antics of the monkeys.
Entrance fee is $8 Aud to get in, but area is well maintained and helps feed the monkeys"
Australia,"The Sacred Monkey Forest was a lot of fun on so many levels. Before we even entered the sanctuary we were greeted by monkeys!

These little scamps are full of energy and can be found everywhere you look. From the swinging through the trees to swimming in the rivers.

A word of warning to the uninitiated, keep your possessions close and watch your backpack (the monkeys can and will open them to find food).

The temple itself is absolutely stunning, itâ€™s carved statues, ponds and towering bridges set into the side of a deep riverbank are reminiscent of a setting straight out of Indiana Jones or Tomb Raider.

Will visit again for sure!"
Australia,"We visited the Monkey Forrest and was a good day out. We checked all the guidelines and made sure we removed any jewellery, hats and sunglasses. We did not see any of the monkeys go for these things but we did see them jump onto two backpacks. I believe this is because they can smell food or they want to know what is it the bag. We saw one person react the wrong way, she hit the monkey when it was on her bag, three monkeys then chased her, so word of advice do not touch the animals. If the monkey does land on your bag keep walking and it will jump off. Don't wear anything shiny, the monkeys don't seem to be bothered by phones or cameras, but please respect their personal space, they don't want a camera shoved in their face. If you leave them alone, they will leave you alone, just don't bring a back pack or water bottle."
Australia,"Absolutely loved it. Was never hassled by the monkeys. Had a small travel bag under my shirt with money, passports, sun glasses and jewellery in it, that we got back out once we left. The monkeys looove shiney things. Do not bring food in, in a bag or backpack. They can smell it and will try to get in to the bag."
Australia,Nice walk but moneyâ€™s intrusive. Not worth the visit. Tourists have caused this by their poking and attention given to the monkeys
Australia,"One of the better tourist sites to visit while in Ubud. We arrived early in the morning, in time for the morning feed. While it is said, the monkeys can be aggressive - grabbing sunglasses off your face, trying to go through your bag - none of this happened during our visit"
Australia,"We had a great day full of enjoyment at monkey forest in ubad the Greenery, waterfall, monkey every thing awesome. I must recommend people to go monkey forest"
Australia,Agree with the comments that there are many more humans than monkeys but it is a unique experience and set in beautiful surrounds. Part of a day tour and pleased we went.
Australia,"Lots of people were feeding the monkeys trying to get photos even though not permitted. I was minding my own business and a monkey jumped on me out of nowhere, I was not alarmed initially as I had interacted with monkeys at Uluwatu temple and had no issue. The monkey tried to go through my backpack and then bit my arm, wouldnâ€™t get off me and people started yelling to run so I ran off and eventually the monkey jumped off. Went to the clinic where I was told there was no need to worry as all monkeys are tested for rabies. They assured me they â€œhave a certificateâ€ and kept repeating this. When you have thousands of monkeys in an open forest there is no way to guarantee that 100% of the monkeys are healthy. I went to emergency anyways and got two rabies shots and medicine. Was advised that monkeys in Bali could also carry â€œVirus Bâ€ which causes brain damage and death so had to get pills for that as well for two weeks. Will need another two rounds of rabies vaccine in Australia, luckily had tetanus shot before coming on the trip. Overall this experience is not worth it and overrated. There is a reason such places donâ€™t exist in Australia or North America where we have real safety standards. Most shocking part was reaction of staff there saying no need to see a doctor and guaranteed healthy monkeys, the doctors in Ubud did not agree. I would avoid this place if I were you, the animals are unpredictable and not worth the nightmare."
Australia,"I was a bit scared about seeing the Bali monkeys after reading scary review about tourists getting bitten etc at the Uluwatu Monkey Forest, but the Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary in Ubud was not scary at all, just peaceful and beautiful. Follow the recommended rules and you'll have an amazing time!"
Australia,These Little guys and girls were so cute and funny. Not aggressive at all. Only $8 Australian as well which included free parking.
Australia,"Sacred Monkey Forest is but one of many treasures found in Ubud, but a must do...
Be sure to cross the bridge, what I call ""The Indiana Jones"" experience to the temple of...
Yes as in the name, there are monkey's on mass...
My advice - take no food and do not buy banana's on entry, unless your a monkey lover!
Enjoy, its amazing."
Australia,The location is beautiful and very well laid out. The monkeys themselves are quite intimidating but as long as you donâ€™t feed them they keep to themselves
Australia,"It was a unique experience to see soo many monkeys in their natural habitat doing what monkeys do. Lots of baby monkeys. Wardens were on hand to look after tourists and to get monkeys to scram.
Monkeys are not scared of humans. Best to keep bags closed and not carry food or water bottles. I had the monkeys try and get my water bottle a few times.. and actually saw a monkey try and operate the drinking fountain.
Very smart little dudes and very cute!
Cost 80,000 IDR (Adult)
"
Australia,"Costs a few bucks (I think $au8) to get into the park, but well worth a look around. They behave natural and you're in their environment on their terms. They don't steal your glasses but the cheaky buggers will check your pockets if they smell something."
Australia,"Visited Sacred Monkey Forest and well worth the trip. $AUD8 entry fee and get to see lots of the monkeys. They do interact with you in terms of climbing on you so need to keep everything concealed like hats & sunglasses as they will take these.

Can get around in under an hour."
Australia,"This place is really clean and well organised. Most of the resorts drop off and pickup here.
The monkeys are cared for well and thereâ€™s no evidence of mistreatment.
They are also kept in their mostly natural habitat so if you hate zoos this place will work well for you.

Be prepared to walk a fair distance around and up and down stairs."
Australia,The Sacred Monkey Forest us home to the Balinese long tailed monkeys. There are about 750 monkeys which live in the lush green forest. The forest is located in the town of Ubud which is easily accessible from most hotels or resorts. There are numerous ancient temples which are located within the forest. The monkeys can get rather aggressive so we found it best to just look & not feed them.
Australia,Our visit to the Monkey Forest was outstanding. We were told to be super weary of the monkeys. Our visit found them to be very placid. Maybe we got lucky
Australia,We found this a great spot to wander and watch the monkeys. Take heed the warnings about not feeding monkeys!! Thereâ€™s always one id*%t though as we found. They leave you alone if you donâ€™t have food in your hand or put things down.
Australia,This has transformed since I first came 20 years ago...but still a unique must see in all of Asia. If you come to Bali this would be my first stop.
Australia,"As the name suggests, lots of quite tame monkeys in a forest setting - but they are accustomed to getting fed and are quite demanding"
Australia,"This is a must! The monkeys are free and have lots of space. It's delightful. Be sure to read the rules before you go in. Take off sunglasses, jewellery etc and keep in a back pack."
Australia,"Cute monkeys everywhere a delight to watch.
But remove your sunglasses earrings etc...hang on to your bags and valuables they are so quick to snatch what they can.
A leisurely walk through the monkey forest is fun watching these delightful creatures"
Australia,Being in Bali for me is better spend time in water activities and beaches . But if you have time is a good idea go to Ubud area and visit this place . I paid approximately 6 American dollars and the good thing is to be in the same place than many monkeys freely in their natural environment
Australia,"Within 10 minutes of being in forest, I witnessed 5 incidents with the monkeys. A monkey grabbed the back of my backpack, a monkey bared its teeth at a friend, grabbed a bracelet off a girl, wrapped itself around a water bottle and the girls leg, then fought with 2 other monkeys for the bottle ! I know you shouldn't take food or drink into forest, you are asking for trouble. Luckily no one bitten but it was close ! You can see monkeys in Ubud in the street near forest and on tour out from Ubud where the monkeys are much better behaved. Give the monkey forest a miss. I couldn't wait to get out !!"
Australia,"A great experience for people of all ages (maybe not under 2). The monkeys are very tame (compared to 5 years ago when I first visited). There are keepers everywhere in case of anything. The grounds themselves are lovely, with a lot of greenery and peaceful areas."
Australia,The monkey forest demonstrates the coexistence of humans and nature. Several temple festivals are held within the grounds of the monkey forest. The area enclosed by the temple walls and the forest area around it is considered sacred.
Australia,"This is a wonderful experience walking in a beautiful forest amongst so many monkeys, mothers and babies, monkeys on the path with you, monkeys eating, monkeys playing. The walk down into the valley is worth it alone. There are many steps so you need to be fit.
"
Australia,"A must do for families or those who havenâ€™t seen monkeys before. The sanctuary had no boundaries so the monkeys truely are free to roam. They are very used to humans as well so there are plenty to see!!

$8 AUD per adult to enter, we only spent about 30-45 mins here after walking around once. It was nice but not a must-do for everyone."
Australia,"We paid 80,000IDR entry, it doesnâ€™t take long to get around and really there isnâ€™t much to it, but itâ€™s very beautiful greenery... and the monkeys are just roaming around eating, playing and relaxing.
They are very cute to watch.
No food is allowed and I would also remove all jewellery, my driver advised these monkeys werenâ€™t too naughty and well managed by the many staff patrolling the grounds, but 2 still jumped up on me to take my necklace and bobby pins. I conceded letting the necklace go as it was a roped clear quartz and he wasnâ€™t giving up on having it. Eventually one of the staff noticed and was able to get the monkeys off me as I wasnâ€™t game to push them down.
They are still animals and you can get quite close to them, so you have to be cautious I guess, these two ran up me from nowhere.
My son found them cute but lost interest after an hour ðŸ˜Š"
Australia,"I'm really glad that we visited the monkey forest. I could have spent all day there. These cheeky monkeys were so entertaining. Wonderful to see them in their natural environment free to roam & play & just be monkeys.The babies were so cute. Don't miss going, it's well worth it."
Australia,Monkey Forest is a nice relaxing place to spend a nice afternoon. Lots of photo opportinities there . Bring only bottled water no food needed otherwise you get unwanted attention from the monkies. Do not chase or tease them and you'll be alright. Enjoy Arpad Karpati Sydney Australia
Australia,"Cheap tourist attraction, not good if children are frightened of monkeys. Very beautiful scenery and walking tracks."
Australia,"There are a few options to see monkeys in Bali. But this is by far the best. Monkeys are mostly friendly and used to people.

Staff are good as well.
Highly recommend."
Australia,"Enjoyed this place a lot, we spent 3 hours walking around. Did not realise how big the park actually was...Please read sign before you go in..I was amazed how many people did not abide by rules..."
Australia,"If you want up close and personal without bars... this is the place to see, touch and have Magical Monkey Moments and also Bats and traditional dress up photos.
Upon arrival you will be allocated a guide who will â€œprotectâ€ you from any aggression that may come from the monkeys. You need to be aware of your surroundings and approach the Sanctuary with wits and respect.
The monkeys are not shy to climb on you providing you have something to offer them to eat and this is truly a case of understanding that you are on their turf.
It was amazing to be so close to these very puppy like animals. The tour ends with your guide welcoming you into her shop where you are not obligated to buy anything but is seen as a form of donation or good luck for them if you do."
Australia,This was my 3rd trip to Ubud and first visit into Monkey Forest. I had always been able to watch these cheeky monkeys from outside. There was a common area just off the road but it has had some work done and you need to pay to go in and watch them. Reasonable fee and this is a nice park to roam. But donâ€™t worry if you miss it.
Australia,"Was a great place to visit. Was really nice to get up and close to the monkeys. Well worth doing if you are in Ubud.
"
Australia,"Was not expecting the absolute HUGENESS of this place.
It does exactly what is says on the tin and it's so beautiful. So much green and well crafted architecture and monuments.

The staff are really funny when they play with the monkey.
We kept walking around and kept finding new little pathways to go down.

I will be going back if I'm ever back in Ubud"
Australia,"This is a great unique experience for all of about AU$8 entry. The Forest is inhabited by more than 800 wild monkeys, all fed and maintained by over 300 staff. The funds from your entry ticket go back into maintaining the Forest which is very well kept. The walk ways are easy to navigate and not too steep. I could sit and watch the monkeys all day! Whilst we read many reviews about the monkeys stealing personal belongings and jumping on people, we did not experience this on our visit. We are merely visitors to their home so itâ€™s important to respect and follow the signage around the Forest as their behaviour can be unpredictable. This is a great facility and unique experience in Ubud!"
Australia,"I thought this park was going to be scary with all the stories I heard about the monkeys but found to the contrary the monkeys were well behaved. I think the key is not to have any food on you. It was a lovely walk in the forest park and they have a pond with lots of large, beautiful carp fish. Certainly a nice break from the hustle in town. Take the time to visit when in Ubud."
Australia,"We had an absolute ball at the Monkey Forest in Ubud. It was one of the highlights of our trip in Bali.
The monkeys are literally everywhere, in trees, on seats, in water, on hand railings.
Just make sure you follow the rules and do not feed the monkeys or look at them in the eyes for too long as they will take it as a threat and become aggressive to you. One tourist handed a monkey a peanut then all hell broke loose. Heaps of other monkeys then jumped all over him and started tugging and biting at him!
We saw baby monkeys which were the most entertaining, playing with each other like human kids.
The big ones are quite scary so stay away from them!
Overall we highly recommend going to see the Monkey Forest.
A great place for all."
Australia,"Great to see the monkeys playing and eating, it was very hot when we went, but thereâ€™s plenty of shade and places to sit and watch for as long as you like. loved it."
Australia,"Better than I thought, a nice sanctuary for monkeys and humans alike. About $8 to enter, it's cool and shady under the forest canopy, and monkeys abound. Spend an hour."
Australia,"Such an amazing place. Loved this place. The staff lovely ,the monkeys so cute. A must to see when in Bali"
Australia,Fantastic meandering walkways through tropical rainforest. Friendly monkeys. Clean & well organised venue.
Australia,"Great visit to see the monkeys. Don't have food in your bag, don't wear jewellery, sunglasses or hats. Just walk & enjoy"
Australia,"We were on our way to a babi guling warung when we decided to stop off and walk around this monkey forest. We did not expect so many monkeys! It was great. They aren't afraid to come up to you, so make sure to take care of your belongings."
Australia,After our transfer from our accommodation to Ubud we walked the length of the Main Street to see the monkeys. The walk was along well maintained paths with plenty of tourists and monkeys. Our favourite was the baby monkeys!
Australia,"Something different for a change. A beautiful walk in the forest, nice temple and...monkeys everywhere ðŸ˜ƒ. Be sure not to wear any sunglasses or shiny jewelry as it may get stolen together with your water bottle ðŸ˜‚."
Australia,"The Monkey Forest was a pleasant surprise, and not what I had anticipated. It was very clean, and very well maintained. There were attendants nearby everywhere, ensuring the safety of both the guests, and the monkeys, I assume. But they were discrete.
"
Australia,"This is a beautiful park with amazing architecture and, as expected, monkeys everywhere.

Be ready to take a lot of pictures.

Also please follow the recommendations and do not interact or look the monkeys in the eyes. It's for your own safety. Don't be the 'ugly tourist'."
Australia,"This is one of the best â€œattractionsâ€ in ubud , you must come here and visit it.
Be careful at the bags and wallet , cause these monkeys are professional thief.
DONT bring any food inside , you will found already inside the forest locals selling you proper food for monkeys.."
Australia,Lovely forrest with open access to the monkeys. Beautiful carvings and statues and a great waterfall walk. Close to shopping and resturants so you can make a day of it.
Australia,"A great place to visit, especially if you love wild life.
Amazing temples and sculptures throughout.
Great experience."
Australia,"There is a very thin line that separates us from the monkeys as seen in the Sacred Monkey Forest. It's so much fun to watch their unique little personalities.
There was Mumma, caring for her little one, a very cute and demanding baby. Grandad was grumpy as usual and bared his teeth a little too much for my liking but at least his were real. The brothers fought, rolling around and jumping on each other, the sisters groomed, primping and preening, they just needed a mirror.
Dad stood guard, watching the passing parade of humans with a watchful eye over his family. He stepped in when the kids got a little rough and pulled one monkey off the other. Uncle was always trying to score the next best deal and tried real hard to secure a pair of Ray Bans off a lady's unsuspecting head.
Aunt was busy squawking to the monkey beside her. Sounded like they were having a heated argument, probably debating the large gold hoop choice of a pretty Indian woman and whether they would look good on them.
Grandma observed with a skilled eye as one of the Sanctuary workers prepared them all a snack. He chopped corn cobs into a bucket and once full scattered it on the ground. Grandma hollered and the ""family"" came running. Pushing and shoving, scrambling to get the first piece. Yep it's just like home!

Set in a beautiful forest complete with temples, carvings and stone statues, a cemetery and crematorium, and a health centre for the care of the monkeys, this is a must see."
Australia,"The have to be the luckiest monkeys in the world. Their environment is a tropical paradise. Most tourists respect their space, and like me, felt lucky to see them interacting with each other and playing - but there is always that one tourist that ignores the signs to get the edge on their Instagram pic. Respect their space people."
Australia,cheeky little buggers try to pinch your things so try to put everything in your pockets & don't carry bags or backpacks
Australia,"When in your in Ubud, the Monkey Forest is a great place to spend a few hours. Entry is cheap, lots of staff to ensure your visit is safe , and lots of monkeys. This was our second visit and have never had any problems with the monkeys. As well as the monkeys, the walk through the forest is fascinating. Huge tress, thick jungle and statue everywhere.
Well worth the visit."
Australia,Be careful and listen for directions and guidance about the monkeys..there are hundreds to see. Its a great experience
Australia,"Stunning sanctuary with giant,shady trees, a flowing stream, rock statues and many cheeky monkeys running, swinging and climbing. Cute baby monkeys. Inexpensive entrance fee of approximately five Australian dollars. One monkey jumped onto someone's backpack and grabbed a hanging plastic water pouch and ripped it open with its teeth. Heed the signage and don't provoke the monkeys. A great way to spend a couple of hours roaming around with monkeys."
Australia,Beautiful sacred monkey forest is in incredible and enchanting forest nestled deep in the heart of Ubud. Full of beautiful monkeys frolicking and playing amongst a backdrop of dense jungle this is a must do experience when visiting Ubud. Get lost in Breathtaking and captivating scenery as you explore your way through the forest. A beautiful magical and great day out!!!
Australia,"If you wished to be harrassed by monkies , have your , purse , bag , chains , watches and food stolen by mischieveous Monkies , then attend the Ubud Monkey Forest
If you are really lucky you may even get sctatched or bitten , then rquire your Rabies shots."
Australia,"This is a must do for Ubud - you are literally surrounded by cheeky little monkeys in lush surroundings.

Common sense should prevail, you are surrounding yourself with semi wild animals therefore be respectful of their space, you are in their domain.

Other than common sense, enjoy watching these little cheeky creatures and be prepared for them stealing food from your bag!

The walks through the park were very beautiful and tranquil.

Expect to pay about $40AUD for entry and you will spend about 2-3hrs here"
Australia,"The Monkey Forest is a great activity and you get exactly what you expect. The monkeys are not bothered by the humans at all, but will react if you get too close! We saw lots of cute baby monkeys being nursed and playing around.

A word of warning: if it's a sunny day and you hear a pitter-patter on the roof, don't look up, because it's probably a monkey doing a wee."
Australia,"We are a couple and really enjoyed watching the monkeys, their different attitudes, their sneakiness, their funny behaviour, and fight bursts. The forest was also a welcoming relief from the heat of the day. We were quite scared about reports of monkeys aggressiveness. We have seen none of it. On the contrary, my wife had enjoyed a close encounter with 3 of the little creatures jumping on her shoulder. Just relax."
Australia,interesting forest that seems so close to main roads. pretty good set up for tourists...need to watch your belongs tho....
Australia,"This is a must do while in bali.
Just be careful as a monkey did try to bite me when another monkey climbed up my shirt, it must have been jealous. A truly special place."
Australia,"This place is huge, plenty of different trails to follow. Lots of monkeys doing there thing. Felt weird having monkeys walk / run past you at first, but then you get used of them being around. Great attraction for all ages!"
Australia,"Great day trip from Seminyak - our 7 year old boy loved watching the monkeys and exploring the park with all of the stone animal sculptures, tunnel, bridges and stairways. It is shaded and cool and one area has a walkway adjacent to a rushing stream. Perfect for this age group. Ice creams at the kiosk at the end. Reasonably priced and we spent half a day here. Several toilets in the area. They prefer you fo not touch the monkeys but they regularly feed and you are within a metre / really close for pictures."
Australia,"Highly recommend Monkey Forrest especially if you love animals and want to get up close! We got to see heaps of monkeys and had plenty of great photo opportunities, due to the high amount of people that visit though the monkeys arenâ€™t so interested (as it seems from other reviews) as climbing on you unless you have something that sparks their curiosity, lucky for me I had cloloured braids in my hair from the day before and they thought this was the best thing out and at one point I had three monkeys on me playing with my hair, they also liked my partners checkered shirt and pulled everything out his pockets to investigate so beware of any valuables you might have! Although the attention from the monkeys was welcomed and appreciated by us, this made other monkeys jealous and we thought is best to stop the interactions. Despite this it was a fabulous experience and we would definitely go back! Entrance to the park is about $8.00 AUD"
Australia,Expected the monkeys to rob my bags and stuff (from previous experience at Monkey sanctuaries overseas). The monkeys here are calm and cute.
Australia,"50,000 rph well spent. Funny to watch the monkey and the scenery is beautiful. Donâ€™t take your water bottle in with you, we watched the lady in front of us have a monkey climb up her like a tree trying the grab her bottle."
Australia,A definite must do while in Bali however please be careful with what you take it. A monkey climbed up on my back and opened my backpack and stole my headphones! We were lucky it was just that. Would still recommend but just be mindful that your belongings can be stolen.
Australia,"Had to get from one side to the other. We had a restaurant booking and had a booking time. It was after six pm.
While we really didn't walk through the forest, just along it, there was still plenty of action, with monkeys everywhere.
I never thought I would get that close.
They, however couldn't have cared less about me, and went along with their business.
Hahahahaha
Interesting place, looked lush and green"
Australia,"We entered this forest at around 10am and spent about 1.5hrs inside.
The rules are clear and repeated and posted often - don't stare down a monkey, don't touch even if they touch you and do not feed them.
It is obvious from the outset that these monkeys have more than enough food however if you even touch a crinkly bag you will have at least 3 monkeys to contend with within seconds. A very special treat that the guides provide is bananas.
The monkeys came across as content, argumentative amongst themselves and seemed to be vascilate between curiousity and exploration, being playful and fighting or deeply bored and restful. These states would change at a moments notice and t the sudder grunts, growls and rushed run ups easily scared the humans. It could be a bit unnerving having a monkey picking, biting or staying to play with your clothing, but it seemed harmless. There were alot of guides around whose presence was reassuring.
So in summary. A nice place to sit, relax (sort of) and just observe interesting behaviours. ..humans and monkeys alike!"
Australia,"Visited this place while on our day tour of Ubud. Entrance was IDR100,000 per pax (about AUD$10) and you get to walk around a reserve and there's hiking trails too. The monkeys are pretty entertaining but can get very territorial about food.

Interesting experience but won't be rushing back."
Australia,"I love this place. I could sit here for hours and just watch the monkeys they are feee to roam, climb trees and interact as they choose. There are guides all around to help both tourists and monkeys. I felt so peaceful sitting amongst the natural forest. Highly recommend - just donâ€™t take valuables or any food!!

"
Australia,A nice forest park in Ubud that's well worth the visit. I spent about 2hrs here and really enjoyed it. There are heaps of monkeys & some are friendlier than others. A word of warning some of the pathways are a bit slippery.
Australia,"Cost 50k, just stroll and watch the monkeys play. Plan on a couple of hours, beautiful forest too. Don't carry food, I put my day pack down and a monkey opened the zippers!"
Australia,Ive been to the monkey forest twice now and both times i had a great time. So many monkeys just everywhere miding their own business or eating in large groups at the feeding stations. Sometimes the monkeys will climb onto you and steal things off you ot just sit on you and eat. I never had a bad interaction with them but i did see them growl and show their teeth to some people that got a little to close. Veru fun place to visit
Australia,The monkeys are cheeky and great little thieves but well worth the visit. The temple and structures are amazing to see
Australia,It was fun to see the monkeys playing and eating freely. We only visited for a short time but it was a lovely forest.
Australia,"This was on my list of must visit places in Ubud and I am totally glad I had the chance to go.!!

The monkeys are not bothered about people walking around and on occasion fall out of the trees and give you a little fright.

You will see adult monkeys relaxing and grooming each other, baby monkey cuddling their mothers and climbing in the trees and they also have a rehabilitation center where they separate the sick, injured and disabled monkey's from the others so that they will survive. In the rehabilitation center they have a blind monkey who loves a chin and head rub and to hold your hand... What an absolute joy it was to meet that guy ðŸ˜

They ask you not to bring any food or drink (open or sealed) as the monkeys WILL steal it and it is not good for them.. Please be respectful of this. I did see a baby monkey chewing on a piece of plastic ðŸ˜’. I also witnessed a monkey steal an unopened packet of cigarettes from someone's pocket, open it and put the cigarettes in its mouth one by one until one of the sanctuary staff came and the monkey dropped them and ran... While it was amusing and quite funny to see, it was upsetting that this person was happy to let the monkey have them and was going to walk away if not for his girlfriend alerting the staff.

Definitely visit this place though....ðŸ™Œ"
Australia,"What an excellent place to visit! So pretty. Beautiful gardens to wander through viewing the monkey's in their natural environment. We had no problems with monkey's trying to jump on us or take our sunnies, jewellery, etc. Follow the advice to not carry food or drinks and you will not have any problems. Lots of photo opportunities. A great cafe for food and drinks. All very reasonably priced. We thoroughly enjoyed our afternoon and recommend visiting the monkey Forest."
Australia,"After travelling to Ubud many times and having concerns about the monkeys and visiting with children we decided to have a look, without children.
Overall I do admit that we were unnecessarily cautious, the monkeys generally give you space and only pay interest in you if you have food, drink or something interesting.
The area has some great photo opportunities with and without monkeys. There is always a proud mother or father laying around with a miscevious little one hanging off them.
If you are patient you can get some photos which look like you are the only one there, or just ask someone to get a photo for you, they may ask for a return gesture.
The visit is worth the 50k IDR entry fee as you can easily fill in a coulee of hours here."
Australia,"The grounds & gardens that they have created in this sanctuary are magnificent, the board walk to the huge fig tree & waterfall are just beautiful."
Australia,"I visited here on my last trip to Ubud and this place has changed a lot. You used to be able to buy food and feed the monkeys. They no longer allow this. The monkeys seem to be a lot more aggressive now. There are people there to keep the monkeys ""in check"" and they tell you not to touch the monkeys. Be sure to hang on to your belongings as the monkeys are quick and will take anything they can from you. On both of my visits here I have seen them take water bottles from people. The monkeys then open the water bottles and drink it."
Australia,Lovely to see monkeys in the wild. Park staff seemed friendly and helped other tourists with dealing with monkey climbing on people or taking personal items. All quite friendly and lovely to see them eating corn cobs and sweet potatoes.
Australia,Loved this experience and to walk around the beautiful grounds was so much fun. The monkeys are well feed and do not try and interact with you unless you walk close to them.
Australia,You just walk around and see monkeys. Nothing else. It has a pretty temple and nice stream but yeah. It's okay
Australia,We been there last week ... the place is beautiful but the day that we visited had some areas closed for cleaning or something. Not much to see though â¤ï¸But Iâ€™d recommend for sure :)
Australia,If you like monkeys this is a nice way to see them. They were all pretty chilled and not as aggressive as other monkeys I have seen in Asia! Heaps of little baby ones too.
Australia,It had been quite a few years ago that we had visited the monkey forest. Things have changed here with the no feeding policy and it is so much better now. The monkeys are much more well behaved. The best place in Ubud for photographs.
Australia,"Last time I went here in 2012/13 people greeted you at the entrance selling food for the monkeys. This is now gone , with a responsible population control program now in place.

The monkey population as a result seems much more well behaved then my last visit. You didnâ€™t see monkeys jumping all over people, except when certain tourists decided to try and play with them...

Do not touch, enjoy the beautiful Forrest! It is safe - donâ€™t stress. Take the obvious precautions and you will be ok"
Australia,We have visited twice now (2015 & 2019 and this time found there is now an impressive international standard visitors entrance and center. Once you are inside you are free to roam the paths and watch the monkeys. Great place to spend an hour or two and good to see regular food stations and staff are now provided for the monkeys and we saw no tourists feeding the monkeys this time.
Australia,"we loved it, but had a few near misses with aggressive monkeys. Best to not purchase food and enjoy watching other people get climbed on."
Australia,"Really cool activity to do, not expensive only $5 for an adult the monkeys are very chilled and nice walk around the park"
Australia,Just loved watching these fascinating creatures in their natural habitat. The grounds are beautifully kept and the coffee shop does great coffee.
Australia,"We went to the monkey forest as part of a day long tour around Bali. It was a lovely walk around with some interesting statues around the place. You can buy little bananas to lure the monkeys to run at you and sit on your shoulders and/or head and fight over bananas. Theyâ€™re pretty clever and will ignore you if you donâ€™t have any food for them. I opted not to buy any bananas because I wasnâ€™t in the mood to have monkeys climb on me (I still had the rest of the day to get through and didnâ€™t like the idea of feeling dirty (monkey fleas etc) or not being able to clean up straight afterwards (I donâ€™t have OCD but there are limits!). We saw some tiny adorable baby monkeys and some big scary intimidating monkeys. The guides stressed not to make eye contact with any monkeys because theyâ€™d take it as a threat (but just between you and me I made eye contact with a couple and they didnâ€™t attack me). There was a part in the forest where they have a few extra-trained monkeys and you can pay to get a better photo with one or all of them sitting on you. There was a big temple/structure in the middle of the forest but I didnâ€™t go in (not sure if you could). The building at the entrance had nice toilets and a place to refill a water bottle, as well as a cool pond/not with massive koi swimming around. I think they were koi anyway...could have been goldfish. Anyway it was a nice experience. The worst thing was seeing two adult monkeys fighting over a tiny newborn monkey...literally grabbing an arm each and pulling and shrieking while the baby was screaming. I may have yelled at them and gone to split them up but it was over as fast as it started. Probably for the best because I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™d go in a monkey fight (usually Iâ€™M the monkey and I have Diddy Kong at my side).
This was a fun place to visit. Just keep an eye on your kids because itâ€™s a big area with lots of distractions and you donâ€™t want your kid to get freaked out by a curious monkey or wander off or get lost or worse."
Australia,"Cost to enter is 50k rupiah per person and kids under 3 is free. We used it as a passage to go through to ubud market as it is shady and on that day is quite breezy.

If you like to see lots of monkey on free range, probably is worth it."
Australia,"Interesting to see them in their natural habitat. Not sure what I was expecting, but felt a bit underwhelmed after the experience."
Australia,"I spent a few hours walking through the monkey forest and thought it was fun and good for a laugh.
We did see tourists being climbed on by the monkeys and 1 was bitten.
We had no problems from the monkeys.
If you just follow the warnings you will be fine and have fun."
Australia,"When we visited we were told that a lot was closed off due to sterilisation of the monkeys, but tickets are same price which I thought was abit unfair. We had been told about how the monkeys can jump on you etc, as soon as we walked in one jumped on our 5 year old! Think it was cause she still had the map of the sanctuary in her hand and the monkey took it ha! There is some beautiful nature to look at whilst in there but not much else to do."
Australia,"Lovely walk through the forest , so peaceful and beautiful, the monkeys are cheeky as just need to watch your belongings as they tend to sneak up on you ðŸ¤£"
Australia,Had a great time wondering around the monkeys. Amazing animals and so much fun to watch. Take the time to enjoy.
Australia,Well worth the visit to the monkey forest. The forest itself is spectacular and then thereâ€™s the monkeys they are so cheeky - we watched one grab lollies out of another tourists backpack and others climbing a tree doing cannonballs into the pool. The only downside is that we saw some monkeys chewing on plastic bottles not sure if the got them from s bin or if there were litterers
Australia,"Great place loved the river walk, the temples are great to see especially if you are there whilest cermony going on. The monkeys are great to watch, however they are naughty. they will take plastic bags off you and will climb up on you to get them"
Australia,"Definitely a must see attraction of Ubud! A completely different world with something to see around every corner. Reasonable entry price (50,000) and additional option to buy food and get a photo taken with a monkey (20,000). The foundations are breath taking, and itâ€™s definitely an experience being within close contact with so many monkies and seeing them interacted with each other. Itâ€™s crucial you read the rules and make sure you take off anything dangly and sunnies off the top of your head. Might be a bit full on with the little ones - monkies donâ€™t follow rules or personal space.
Definitely recommend - was an amazing experience."
Australia,"What can I say
Bloody monkeys. It's ok if you like walking monkeys are everywhere so be warned I dint think little kids will like it as they are a bit scary I myself was wary but it's ok"
Australia,"Wonderful experience in an aesthetically beautiful sanctuary. If you stick to the amply displayed rules interaction with the monkeys is easy and delightful. Magic place! Tip - take drinks, none for sale within the sanctuary."
Australia,"Only bit of advice if you at all skirmish or scared of monkies .. please do not go here

Listen to the guides , do not feed them, give them eye contact and or try to actually cuddle them like tame animals .. they are wild animals and as such need to be treated as such

We watched a lady have her ear bitten as she obviously was not able to listen and did everything that she was told not to do !!!

But seriously listen unless you want to visit a doctor .. Ubud is amazing and all you have to do it listen to the advice of the guides"
Australia,"I was undecided about going as Iâ€™ve seen monkeys before. But our children were interested (5yrs, 12yrs). It was really enjoyable being able to stroll along the pathways and boardwalks amongst the monkeys. Cheeky fella ripped my cloth tote bag and stole my water bottle that was hidden. Most thankful it wasnâ€™t my purse! There are gorgeous statues to admire and photograph and a beautiful stream. Accessible for wheelchairs for most areas. We were done after 1.5 hours. Glad we went. Surprised how cheap it was to get in."
Australia,"We had a driver take us here. Definitely worth a visit. Our driver stayed with us through the park. They donâ€™t let you feed the monkeys as in the past anymore but our driver slip a ranger some money and we had unlimited interaction, safely, with the monkeys jumping on our shoulders, I again mentioned safely."
Australia,"We have been to the front, the back and inside over the years but this time was the first time around the back where our Balinese family took us this time. Lots if beautiful Balinese couples having pre wedding photos taken in their beautiful costumes only too happy to share a photo with us, plenty of monkeys, a beautiful walk and probably snakes. Around the front at the bottom of monkey forest Rd the monkeys will keep you entertained for as long as you want to hang around but be reminded they are wild. Plenty of photo ops at the front babies and all. We haven't been inside for a few years now because I think you get better viewing from the carpark across the road, they are a lot higher up as you walk through the forest. Love the ubud monkeys but even if you sit across the road they will run across the road to see what you have in your bag. DON'T LEAVE YOUR BAGS ON THE GROUND AND ZIP THEM UP."
Australia,"Enjoyable experience. Watch out for any unsecured items or open bags. They are quick & once they have their hands on your wallet, sunglasses mobile phone you will be very lucky to see then again."
Australia,Monkey Forest is an amazing experience. The monkeys are walking around everywhere. They donâ€™t jump on you unless you have food. Rangers walk around too making sure you are safe. Lovely cool forest scenic.
Australia,"Great place to visit in udbud. Easy to walk to, but watch out monkeys can be cheeky. They stole out water bottle"
Australia,"A great experience! This is my second monkey sightseeing activity. I didnâ€™t initially want to participate and put my money into something that could be classed as cruelty (after my first encounter at a different location many years ago) but this forest had a much better vibe and my partner really wanted to see them. The monkeys were still cheeky but had plenty of space away from paths and tracks to live in the beautiful surroundings. Do follow the rules, stay calm if one jumps on you or gets too close. The rangers are throughout the park to make you feel comfortable and help you if such an event occurs."
Australia,Great fun to see the monkeys. Cheeky little monkeys that stole a babies cheese sandwich. Couldn't stop laughing.
Australia,Such a great place to wonder around and watch the Monkeys swinging around in the canopy above. Tourists need to step back and observe the monkeys not annoy them.
Australia,"Not a bad experience, but not great. The forest itself is quite nice and good break from the small hustle of Ubud downtown. If you don't like monkeys jumping on you, or being aggressive, it's not a bad experience - there's just better things to do around Ubud."
Australia,Enjoyed our visit and spent a little over an hour with the monkeys. There were lots of them and it was nice to observe these animals in their natural habitat and not in a cage. They were well feed and used to the spectators - as such we did not have any jumping on us and were able to get relatively close for photos. Temple also within the grounds.
Australia,"worth a visit , better than I expected !! I read some reviews and thought monkeys could get naughty , I went in without food and had all my stuff packed in the bag, but ~~~end up tourists are the problem . monkey was all good and behaving , people keep annoying them , I can see they might be the ones complaining about monkeys after piss them off ! be a better tourist and follow the instruction ! human"
Australia,"Beautiful gardens to walk through and see the monkeys. Please make sure you ready the signs and dont feed the monkeys. We saw another tourist feed a monkey and then wondered why another monkey jumped on her.
Other than that, it is really quite safe to walk through and watch them.
Great experience for all ages."
Australia,"Must see if you're in Ubud! Be sure to hold your belongings close to you as the monkeys are very cheeky, and will try grab anything they can!"
Australia,So glad we did venture here. We were contemplating not as we had seen Monkeys in Vietnam but we really enjoyed. The Monkeys appeared to be so happy here and the walk was so beautiful too. Great opportunities for photos and a great get away from the streets
Australia,"it was an amazing walk through the forest , the fact their is Monkeys everywhere was in fact a little irrelevant after seeing about 100 monkeys within the first 10 minutes the rest of the time was just spent exploring the wonderful forest"
Australia,"After four of the six of us succumbed to bali belly, the monkey sanctuary was a brilliant first day recuperating. The antics of the monkeys made for light entertainment whilst enjoying a gentle stroll.
Watch out for the couple of persistant monkeys that can prize open your backpack!!"
Australia,"Monkeys...what can I say. I came here to have monkeys climb all over me and get some great photos.
What did I get..Monkeys climb g me for bananas and some great photos hanging on my wall"
Australia,"We had a fun walk through the monkey forest today. Beware of the monkeys trying to grab your water bottles , hats , sunnies and bags - leave them all in the car. Overall a must see and a lovely walk ."
Australia,"This was a cute day out and a good way to escape the heat. The place is SWARMING with monkeys and lots of fun. They arenâ€™t as cheeky as I thought theyâ€™d be - but will take the opportunity to rummage about in a backpack if they can. There are lots of quiet nooks to sit and relax if the clusters of tourists are bothering you, and we spent a long time just sitting on some swings watching the mothers and their babies clamber about the trees."
Australia,"I was scared to go due the countless panicked reviews. It is natural jungle forest with incredible trees that look like they are climbing to heaven. Take off your jewellery, don't walk around with food in your hand or anything shiny, and you will be left alone. It is a beautiful experience. You can move through quickly, or you can take your time. Perhaps take an umbrella as we were caught out in the rain. The canopy of magic trees protected us, but still an umbrella would have been good. Don't panic, don't scream when the monkey runs in front of you.Just go and enjoy it!"
Australia,"So many monkeys to see combined with awesome statues, rain forest and even a temple. Line to get in not too bad but paths a bit crowded in parts. Lots of stairs to certain parts of the sanctuary but you don't need to go down them - plenty of monkeys and things to see without negotiating stairs so definitely possible to enjoy even if your mobility is limited. There are other entrances to enter than the main entrance - would recommend using those to avoid the crowds."
Australia,"We are a family of 4 with a 5 & 1 year old and loved visiting the monkey forest. Highlight of our holiday.

It was so much fun exploring the grounds, the greenery, waterfalls and scenery is really lovely, add the monkeys roaming around and itâ€™s awesome!

We had no trouble with the monkeys, they went about their own business and were not phased by us. If you stick to the rules as indicated at the entrance youâ€™ have no problems. We did see one couple carrying water bottles be followed by a monkey and the monkey jumped on them a couple of times to try and take their bottles. It wasnâ€™t aggressive, he just wanted the drink bottles. The signs indicate not to carry any food, bottles of too many loose items. Unfortunately this couple took no notice so it was really their fault.

In some areas their are staff watching the monkeys and they have little slingshots to â€œthreatenâ€ the monkeys of misbehaving and to usher them away, we didnâ€™t see this happen as the monkeys were all keeping to themselves.

We saw tiny baby monkeys and older ones, they played in the trees, ate their fruit and veg and rumbled with one another. It was so nice to see them out in the open doing their own thing. You can get close enough to take photos also.

We stayed for about an hour, had it not been so hot I could have spent a few more hours wandering around or just sitting and watching the monkeys. We arrived at 10am and it was not busy at all, as we left though bus loads of tourists were coming in so iâ€™m glad we got there early to avoid the crowds.

There are 3 temples but they are not open to the public unless you are praying and willing to wear the traditional Balinese attire. You can still walk up to the temple and see through the gates if you wish.
"
Australia,"The monkeys are lively and entertaining but it is important not to over react if they happen to climb on you. I had a monkey climb up around my shoulders and down my arm. I was very surprised but I tried not to move and the monkey left of his own accord, no harm done and some great pictures! I did see some people panic when the monkeys got too close and this reaction did not end well. Advice - donâ€™t panic if monkey chooses you."
Australia,We recently visited and while the paths and facilities are being improved there is still the danger of wild animals. One monkey ran up to me tried to get into my handbag and when it failed it bit me twice. I was fortunate as the bite did not break the skin but it could have been worse if it had been an elderly person or small child. Be on alert at all times and don't carry anything the monkeys can snatch.
Australia,"Came here to see the monkeys, and thatâ€™s what we saw.

Nice grounds and well maintained. Quite a few little walks around the grounds to do and fun to watch the monkeys doing their thing.

Word of warning: to ensure a good time, hold onto your handbags ladies and donâ€™t feed the monkeys."
Australia,"The kids loved our visit to the monkey temple. The monkeys are quite tame now because they are fed. It was well kept and there were plenty of photo opportunities with beautiful buildings and scenery. Itâ€™s not very expensive and itâ€™s a must to on a day trip to Ubud - just donâ€™t expect anything exciting, it is just walking around looking at monkeys, temples etc. for the cost itâ€™s worth doing. Watch your belongings."
Australia,"So entering this venue I had heard in years past that the monkeys could be sneaky little pickpockets at the entry however this was due to an old policy of giving the guests bananas to feed them.

A practice they appear to have stopped and has improved the behaviour considerablly. It was a great tour with many different sites and beautiful forests.. The monkeys let you get quite close and seemed to be uniniterested in us and just went about there business.

Food and drinks on site and clean facilities."
Australia,Worth the trip. Enjoyed the monkeys and the beautiful surroundings. The walk down to the river was lovely.
Australia,"My wife and I were holidaying in Bali and staying in Ubud. Our hotel was only a few hundred metres from the monkey forest so I went there while my wife attended a spa. I've got to say it was better than I imagined and only 50,000idr (about $5 ) entry fee. It was a good way to spend an hour or so and very interesting. If you're in Ubud it's worth a look."
Australia,"We loved walking around and seeing the monkeys ðŸ’. The walk around is nice, but some of the steps are slippery from the type of stone.
I donâ€™t think it would be a pleasant place to take young kids or people who are limited in the amount of walking they can do.
I did enjoy watching the monkeys which is what you go for.
Be careful though, they are cheeky - there is enough signage around to tell you what to do and to mind your belongings - even so, we saw a guy get his wallet taken and the staff had to help try get it back.
For $5 Australian for an adult - itâ€™s worth a visit."
Australia,"Visiting Sacred Monkey Forest is hands down the best activity in Ubud! I went there three times because I liked it so much and every time had amazing interactions with the animals. Sit down next to them and they might climb onto you and explore. Be careful with your stuff tough, it might get stolen by the monkeys. Highly recommended!"
Australia,"we enjoyed walking around the forest and watching monkeys attack people trying to feed them. even though it isn't allowed, many people still feed the monkeys until either the ranger comes and disciplines them or the monkeys attack. haha. so much h fun"
Australia,"Our family loved our walk through the forest. Monkeys were fun to look at. Keep your ticket (80k adult, 60k kids) got 15% off restaurants near the entrance- we tried Habitat"
Australia,"The monkeys are very spoiled here and that is exactly what I like to see. They are happy and thriving and so adorable. I had two monkeys â€˜attackâ€™ me but it doesnâ€™t hurt.. they saw my large handbag and wanted to get whatever was in it. I simply shook them off my arms, they are not interested in biting or hurting anyone, but they are very interested in what you have in your bag. This is a must see attraction."
Australia,I visited with my 13 year old son. He was disappointed because the previous year the monkeys had been fighting and the day we went they werenâ€™t. But I really enjoyed seeing the monkeys and the wonderful stone carving and the cool in the forest because of the many trees.
Australia,Staff are pretty rude and disinterested and the whole thing takes less than 30 mins to walk around. Monkeys are actually pretty scary here too - quite aggressive!
Australia,"We enjoyed our walk through the monkey forest. The monkeys are not shy so do NOT take any white plastic bags or tote bags that canâ€™t be properly zipped up, or else youâ€™d better hold it for dear life. The monkeys just jump right on in and open your tote bags or grab your white plastic bags thinking thereâ€™s food, and they are quick to move so you just need to make sure you secure your belongings down well. Itâ€™s beautiful walking through this forest and once youâ€™ve bought that ticket once we were able to use it to pass through the Forest as a short cut to get to town on the other side.
Definitely a must see."
Australia,"This is a well set up venue for tourists with plenty of wide paths and so many monkeys to see! Donâ€™t take in food or drink or they will be after you! A must if in the Ubud region, or from anywhere really."
Australia,A relaxing way the spend the morning wandering through the tranquility of the forest. Itâ€™s AUD8 for adults and AUD5 for kids under 12.
Australia,"*PLEASE DO NOT FEED OR TOUCH THE MONKEYS**

It was lovely to see these animals up close and the forest was beautiful. We had a lovely time strolling along the various paths observing the monkeys.
What was disappointing to see were a handful of tourists showing so little respect and a complete disregard to notices everywhere not to touch or feed these sensitive creatures. The warnings are there for a reason, monkeys can be extremely aggressive and processed food is toxic for them."
Australia,"My boyfriend and I loved it, it was so much fun seeing the monkeys. They were very playful and cute ðŸ˜Š"
Australia,Glad that we have been here for our little ones so that we don't have to do this again. The monkeys of course can be a little intimidating entering their territory and we did witness one tourist get scratched from a monkey after she tried to touch it. Ensuring you have your rabies shots would be an idea.
Australia,"Great fun visit seeing the monkeys up close in their own sanctuary within a dedicated forest. No safety issues, just be sensible and donâ€™t touch them or annoy them: they are very relaxed around people and used to the tourists! The Park Guidelines are everywhere and the Monkeys seem happy and great to see their social interactions. Mums with babies and young ones to see too. Nice little Temple and a pretty little river runs inside the forest, with natural springs."
Australia,"The park is clean, the monkeys cheeky and at times slightly aggressive but no fear- there are guides here and there to make sure people and animals remain cool

RESPECT the guidelines!
to many tourists ignoring bottles hanging from bags
Things in trouser pockets
Dont have anything visible outside your bags!!"
Australia,I've been here before but our friends hadn't so we enjoyed the walk through the forest and found the monkeys very entertaining. It's also very clean and lots of staff around .
Australia,"This was our second visit our first in 2016. You have to pay to enter the Forrest. You are no longer able to feed the monkeys unlike 2016. Where you could purchase bananas to feed the monkeys.
There are guides throughout the Forrest. You still see plenty of monkeys. You are still able to get up close and take photos. Very beautiful Forrest and well worth walking throughout."
Australia,Take your time to enjoy the walk around the monkey forest and enjoy interacting with the cheeky monkeys. Easy walk on well maintained paths. Beautiful gardens and temples to see.
Australia,"Monkeys. Everywhere... In the trees, on the roof tops, crossing the road, in your back-pack... everywhere.

Worth the admission price if monkeys are your thing. Recommend you heed the warnings from the staff - these cheeky critters will not hesitate to climb you like a tree in search of.. well, what ever they fancy.

The walk is pretty easy, and could be as long or short as you want to make it. Thereâ€™s plenty for shade, however, strongly recommend you bring a hat, sunscreen and plenty of water. Itâ€™s all outdoors and gets quite warm."
Australia,Entrance fee Adult 80K & child up to 12 $60k. Lovely to see monkeys in everyday life. Rangers/staff are around to provide information & ensure safety if you are concerned. Steep steps down to creek area. Worth a visit 1-2 hours.
Australia,"We really enjoyed this place. Plenty to see aside from the funny little creatures. Temples, amazing trees and even burial grounds. In fact a grave was being dug while we were there, which was oddly interesting to see and read about."
Australia,"Iâ€™ve never thought of myself as a person scared of monkeys, but this place really tests your limits. The animals are absolutely adorable and ya wanna just snuggle them, but then they get close to you and you no longer wish for snuggles. Do NOT bring bags when you visit as the monkeys approach people with bags, donâ€™t wear hats or sunnies because they little buggers will snatch them right off of you. The staff here are wonderful though and are sure to keep an eye out to ensure everyoneâ€™s safety. Such a neat experience, but also a little sketchy. Still, donâ€™t miss it if youâ€™re in Ubud! Costs only 80,000 for adult entry."
Australia,"We enjoyed watching the monkeys as they can be quite ornery or loving depending ;D What was most interesting to me was the beauty of the trees, temples and statues, especially the temple down below by the river. The roots of the trees hanging down creating curtains across the air were spectacular. I love photographing interesting shots and this was a field day for me!"
Australia,"What a lovely and cool place to be. The monkeys run freely in the area â€œsemi-free rangedâ€ as they are so called and itâ€™s just a nice day to sit and watch them play and frolic.

Remember to keep all items to yourself or in your bag though. They are quick! But it was nice quiet day out with the family in the cool of the jungle.

Plus - toilets were amazingly clean! :)"
Australia,"Relaxing day inside park. There is many footpaths around, with monkeys on every corner. Take as many pictures as you can, as they don't repeat it.
Worth to see."
Australia,"We headed to the monkey forest early (they just opened) and this was a good time to go as not many people were there and the monkeys were being fed. We saw little babies, feeding and plenty of monkey action!
The walk through the forest area to a temple and a very ancient looking bridge through amazing trees was beautiful . My camera had died -otherwise i wouldve taken a lot of photos.
Make use of the free shuttle around Ubud from/to the Monkey forest- great service."
Australia,"Great place to walk around with the monkeys. The sanctuary is clean with plenty of staff caring for the monkeys.
Well worth a visit. 60k entry fee per adult."
Australia,Recently visited the forest again and was extremely disappointed. Within two years the entry price has doubled and it was run down. Too busy spending the money on other thing rather than upkeep. Plenty of other things and places to go rather than the monkey forest. Warning. Dont change your money at bmc pt.bali maspintjinra authorized money changer on monkey forest road. I personally had money taken and since have had a lot of others tell me it happened to them. Maha restaurant near tge forest has always been great for foor and changing money.
Australia,"Slow start with seeing monkeys,but the further we walked the more active the monkeys became.Great photo opportunities whilst walking around.If you are lucky the monkeys put a bit of a show on at the end at the pond.Lost of stories of hats glasses etc being taken from monkeys.Follow the instructions and things will go smoothly."
Australia,"So OK, after reading negative reviews, I was wary. I wasn't even going to go. But our day-trip-driver assured me that it would be fine. It helped that he was really chill. We went first thing when it opened, the monkeys had plenty of food, it wasn't too hot and everyone was calm. I only took my camera and left everything else in the car. I got some amazing shots, the monkeys were completely adorable and we had a great time!!"
Australia,"This is a must do when travelling to Bali, Indonesia is one of the few counties (in my experience) that offer a literal face to face experience.

It is a breathtaking experience and something you'll talk about for years to come, there is so many reviews on this place and very well known so you shouldn't have any trouble of locating it or finding your way around, my top tips are though always keep an eye on your belongings, they will definitely steal items if you give them the chance, if you tease them they won't hesitate in biting or scratching. Due to how they are treated by the workers they are more prone to attacking Men (sad reality but unfortunately one) be sure to take bananas.

Best way to handle the experience is approach the monkeys the same way you would with a dog you see at home, friendly, confidently but with caution.

All in all it is a place that you shouldn't miss out on."
Australia,"Great spot to visit in Ubud with kids. We traveled as 4 adults and 4 kids aged 4-11yrs old and we all loved it. Monkeys werenâ€™t at all aggressive and the grounds are a beautiful jungle to walk through.
Good bathroom facilities and small cafe for refreshments at the entrance/exit. Take heed of the instructions and donâ€™t take food inside the sanctuary as the monkeys will sniff you out and grab it!
Definitely recommend!"
Australia,"The monkeys were cute and at feeding time it was a frenzy.
It was good fun to watch their antics specially the young ones."
Australia,"Monkeys are very cheeky, donâ€™t scream, try to touch them etc. we kept our distance and had no issues.
Trees were spectacular.
Very well maintained and looked after.
Worth doing for $8 AUS each."
Australia,"Great to see these little guys in their â€˜naturalâ€™ habitat. Itâ€™s nice big park to walk around - very relaxing hour or two. 80,000 IDR entrance fee, which includes parking."
Australia,"Delightful old inner city forest garden full of over 1,000 cheeky little monkeys and temples. Didn't expect the beautiful old growth trees and heavy canopy overhead! It was dark and enchanting. If you wear a dress the infant monkeys will try to swing on your hem so just stay calm and keep walking! ðŸ˜‚"
Australia,A grand backdrop for the cute little monkeys. They just go about their day as if nobodyâ€™s watching. A very up close experience. Easy to spend a couple of hours just wandering.
Australia,"After having a great breakfast opposite the main entrance to the Monkey Forest a monkey decided to grab our leftovers. He was none too friendly about it either!!

Our visit to the monkey forest was subsequently a bit tense especially after a monkey decided to jump on the shoulders of a guy in front of us!

It is a beautiful place, but I recommend going at feeding time & not when the monkeys are hungry!!"
Australia,"Was nervous about monkeys stealing sunnies, phones, bags etc. But no dramas! There are staff scattered throughout which look out for the monkeys and tourists. Nice and shady walk with interesting temples throughout. Information signs throughout and great signposting. Would reccomend 1-2 hours here.
One monkey just as we were leaving ran over and grabbed my pants. I followed the signs and didnt panic. Monkey let go after I gently tugged. I did see one lady sit down where the monkeys were and get climbed on, but that's avoidable."
Australia,"Great to see animals treated with respect and care and allowed to roam freely, animals also interact with human beings which is a bonus"
Australia,It was great fun to see the sacred monkey forest however it is crazy humid and full of mosquitos. I didnt use insect repellent and got bitten a lot. The forest itself is beautiful and there are sooo many monkeys which was cute (even though they are crazy energetic)!
Australia,"This is a pretty cool place to visit but be weary the monkeys will steal your items, anything from food to clothing. So either make sure you basically go empty-handed or everything is locked away where they cant get to it."
Australia,"We have visited just about every monkey forest in Bali over the years, including Ubud, it is a pretty location lower in the valley but this is where the enjoyment ended. One of the grandchildren was bitten by an aggressive monkey, unprovoked and had to then take her to BIMC for the start of rabies injections. Of course we had heard all the warnings which had always been headed and yes the monkeys and their babies are great to watch but I am done with monkey parks. Tourists Beware!"
Australia,Very entertaining attraction which you can spend a couple of hours in. Would recommend to do when in Ubud
Australia,"Be early to beat the crowds and the heat of the day.
Be aware if you have a backpack and a monkey jumps on you it's more than likely that they're trying to unzip your backpack to search for goodies to take.
Saying that the monkeys are adorable and absolutely everywhere living in their own habitat and as long as you don't bother them they won't bother you.
Highly recommended."
Australia,"Must see in Ubud. ! Cost is 80,000 IDR per adult for entry but it's easy to spend plenty of time in there. The monkeys are so cheeky and adorable! ðŸ’ðŸ’"
Australia,Nothing special. Monkeys are very aggressive - I was sitting on a bench and they peed on me from above. Be careful about sitting under trees.
Australia,Enjoyed our morning here. Plenty of photo opportunities. Very pleasant walking around the park. Be careful with interaction of the monkey's as they can be aggressive.
Australia,Very good place so many monkeys. Location is great too. One of the monkeys tried to steal my friend spring water which is quite funny
Australia,Good activity to spend time if you are in ubud. Be careful with your caps and sun glasses and belongings as the monkeys may snatch it.
Australia,I think it would be ashame if you go to Ubud and not visit . It's fun for young and old .leave your sunnies and food at your hotel . Go in with nothing and the monkeys will leave you alone.
Australia,It was really cool to see the monkeys around! Would recommend! We didnâ€™t find the cart with bananas which I was super sad about but it was fun to sit next to them and watch them run around!
Australia,"We spent about 1 hour here wandering around the monkey forest, which was really nice! The setting and entrance into the sanctuary is really nicely done, just a shame a few areas that partner had been before and loved were closed off. Would recommend leaving most of your belongings including sunglasses etc behind if you can - monkeys will try to take them if you're not careful. It was lovely to see these intelligent creatures wandering around and interacting with each other. Good value and worth a visit!"
Australia,"We thought we had taken on board some helpful tips about keeping safe at the Monkey Forest. We removed our hats and sunglasses. Placed our bottles of water inside our the 1 backpack we took. Walked in the middle of the path. Observed and enjoyed the monkeys from a distance, took photos using a zoom, didnâ€™t stay in 1 spot for too long. But quicker than a Bourke St mugging- We got robbed! After looking around and not seeing any monkeys close by we took a selfie, then next second a monkey jumps on my back. Unzipped my backpack and stole a bottle of water! Cheeky little things. I kept calm during my robbing, gently removing the backpack and taking a step away. Luckily a ranger was close by and shooed the offered away. Leaving us without a water- that had been bitten into and a belly full of laughs about our robbing. The forest itself was beautiful and well maintained. The monkeys were cheeky and playful and certainly not shy to unzip a bag. It was an experience for sure.
"
Australia,Such beautiful surroundings and the monkeys are super cute! we were all a little nervous after reading the reviews but it is definitely a must do. One jumped on my daughter but the minder instructed it to get off which it did straight away. My daughter loved it and said it was a highlight of her holiday.
Australia,"Cool experience with lots of monkeys doing monkey things. Stick to the rules and you shouldnâ€™t have any problems. In saying that, there is always a risk with wild animal. One had a brief crack at my daughter when she panicked and screamed after locking eyes. I picked her up and shushed her and the monkey moved on."
Australia,"OK for a visit but not really worth the IDR 80,000 entrance fee. We had more fun outside on the road with the monkeys than whilst inside the grounds.
We had a big bag of bananas with us but staff refused to allow us in with them, no great shakes, we left them at reception & collected them when leaving.
I was surprised at the amount of people visiting the monkey forest who appeared to be petrified of monkeys, cowering, hiding & even running away when monkeys came close.
I can say I've visited but I wouldn't visit again!
They definately need to clean up all the plastic bottles & rubbish laying around the forest & in the streams etc. I know people shouldn't be leaving it behind in the first place but its there & awfully messy!"
Australia,"Great place to visit but donâ€™t feed the monkeys as they have a habit of biting.
Go in the late afternoon as it is a bit quieter."
Australia,"We were initially apprehensive to visit here but we had many people tell us the monkeys here were safe and friendly. We decided to just go through with it and pay the place a visit.

No lie, within 30 SECONDS of me walking through the gate and buying a ticket, a monkey jumped on me, bit my wrist and bit my leg. The experience was pretty terrifying and I am an animal lover but I just walked around really on edge. I went to the first aid hut and the guy was really nonchalant and kind of just brushed it off saying I would be fine. He cleaned the bite up.

I just got really on edge and scared so I went to a clinic afterwards and got a rabies shot afterwards. I have to get 3 more and it's going to cost me a pointless amount of money and we didn't even get chance to enjoy the experience at all. Would not recommend."
Australia,Spent some time with some friends walking around the forest with the cheeky little monkeys. Please be careful and make sure you are watching your back at all times seeing that the monkeys stole one of my friends drink and run away with it and two more of our group had monkeys try and steal drinks of hands.
Australia,"We werenâ€™t sure, a bit scared but thank goodness we went. The monkeys are fascinating. Follow the rules and they are ok. We saw them climb on a couple of people but only if they were sitting in a position to encourage and they jumped straight off. If you follow the rules youâ€™ll be fine."
Australia,"I visited this place with a friend and 2 kids. I have been here quite a few years ago and not much has changed (with the exception of the new toilets) I felt sorry for the tourists who were not warned about taking food and drink into the enclosure. Watching the baboons snatching things out of peoples hands and biting them on the leg leaving puncture wounds (drawing blood) was not my idea of a fun day out with the kids. Although when it came to feeding time, it was amazing to hear the whistles being blown and watching the baboons racing to their designated feeding place sitting happy as a pig in mud eating. I would recommend those who go, to be well prepared and show no evidence of food or drinks and to hold your phone/camera or anything shiny away at a good distance. On a funny note, my son thought it was particularly funny when the keeper gave the ape a brownish banana and the baboon threw it on the ground and grabbed a fresh one. One baboon was eating peanuts and would clap his hands together to tell the person he wanted more and he was very insistent clapping until he got fed another one Ha! All in all this is a must see BUT not without warning."
Australia,"We were abit doubtful going here as everyone said the monkeys were vicious and steal things ie sunnies off your head and jump on you especially if you have food in your backpack.
We decided to go against some of our friends reactions and had a wonderful time and is a must if your in Ubud.
The monkeys were being fed by keepers and were quite cute especially we got a pic with a monkey which looked like the monkey took the selfie quite funny.
"
Australia,"I was very nervous going here after hearing the monkeys can be aggressive and unpredictable, but we found that if you follow the rules stated all across the park you should be ok. We were in the smoking area when a monkey came over and tried to take my cigarette from me (maybe thought it was food?), once i had finished I butted out and the monkey was still reaching for it so I gave the butt to the monkey and it jumped on my shoulder and started tearing the butt apart, after a little while I got nervous and didn't know how to get it off but just started walking away it jumped off and went about its business. We did see a monkey attack a packet of peanuts in a ladies bag but bringing peanuts to a monkey forest is definitely not a smart thing to do!"
Australia,"Monkeys were wonderful to watch. Temples were beautiful, especially the water temple where one of the monkeys climbed onto my head. The forest was beautiful to wander through."
Australia,Very busy tourist destination. Monkeys are cute but very quick to steal. The site is very nice to walk around.
Australia,7 month baby in pram. Nice stroll. About 40 mins wondering around a bit of history there. Has monkey staff with monkeys if u want a picture. Something to do. About $8.
Australia,Highlight of my trip. A beautiful forest with amazing temples through out. The scenery is amazing and the monkeys were the cutest. I loved them just follow what the signs say and you will be fine.
Australia,"The monkeys are cute and definitely lots of photo ops here. Be careful though as some of them will take stuff from you. One tried to open my backpack, we saw others that had their bags opened and things taken out.

Would be funny if they didn't bite and scratch you. Staff were helpful if they were there, but some areas there were no staff to be seen."
Australia,"4th visit to the forrest in the last 20 years.
What a change. The man entrance is now very professional and well managed.
All of the entrances and exits require payment for adults and children.
8k for adults 6k for kids at the time of writting.
From prior visits you could pay for bananas and expect to have the monkey's climb all over you.
This is no longer the norm and physical contact with the animals is discouraged, though still happens.
Lots of warnings about not taking bags and other items that may interest the animals, I saw ignored. Monkeys were quick to take advantage and snatch items before running away.
Incredible scenery and trees, great to see the sacred area preserved."
Australia,"We visited the monkey forest as part of a wider Ubud day trip. There are plenty of opportunities for photos with the monkeys and they get quite close as they have been trained with treats to take selfies. The forest itself has some wonderful features and if you are into wildlife, nature and gardens this is a treat. Curved stone pedestrian bridges, hand railing, platforms, lots of lush greenery. Highly recommended if in Ubud."
Australia,We were pleasantly surprised with this monkey sanctuary. It was clean and beautiful to walk around. It was fun to watch the cheeky monkeys play swim and preen each other. The monkeys looked content and playful. A nice morning adventure.
Australia,"Monkeys come close to you, my 12 year old had a gr8 adventure when a monkey climbed on to her shoulder.
Monkeys are trained as long as you are relaxed they donâ€™t harm.
Gr8 place to visit !!!"
Australia,"For $10 NZD (pretty much same AUD) or 5 gbp you can get entry to this amazing Sanctuary for the Monkeys, it's a safe space for them to be looked after. It's very cheap entry, there are a lot of guests there however it is a fun stop for a good price.

It's sort of a reverse zoo? Where you go into their habitat. The monkeys can be interactive, so be smart. If you don't like that - don't go. I did see a few jump around people, one person even got one climbing up their leg!

It is all good fun. A great couple of hours spent."
Australia,"Go to the monkeys forest is really a must to do in Bali! We really enjoyed our experience in here, plenty of monkeys all around the forest and it is a really scenic place!
Highly recommend!"
Australia,There was alot of monkeys and they all looked healthy a happy in a natural environment. Some walkways are Shakey so be careful walking around.
Australia,"We entered from the south where there are lots of baby monkeys. This is a beautiful park.
Lovely temples and the interesting cremation area, where we talked to a worker whose friend is buried there.
Itâ€™s always good to talk to locals to help educate yourself. They are by nature friendly and accommodating.

We were then able to catch the free shuttle up to the palace.

"
Australia,"Monkey forest is an awesome way to see monkeys in a natural habitat but please be mindful that they are still wild. Backpacks, food, water bottles, sunglasses, hats etc. Are all ways to get negative attention from the monkeys and staff will advice that you let go of whatever it is they want or they can become aggressive. A lot of families with young children were visiting when we were there and a young girl was attacked by one just for trying to get a photo next to one.
To avoid being climbed on by monkeys, walk normally past the monkeys but keep a good distance. If your a thrill seeker and don't mind the opportunity, sit quietly and as seen many times one will approach to climb on or over you- warning: do not try pet them though!"
Australia,"Great place friendly staff, monkeys were great entertainment I had one on my back trying to get my water"
Australia,"Love the monkey forest, just think it could be kept a bit cleaner considering you pay to get in so could be put towards the keepers tidying up rubbish etc more. Baby monkeys were super cute. Be careful that you donâ€™t get peed on if they climb on you though, and they will steal stuff."
Australia,"If youâ€™ve survived the traffic to get to ubud then a wander through this jungle like monkey park will be surprising, occasionally funny and so worth it.

The worst part is the human monkeys doing exactly what the signs say you should not!

Watching humans watching monkeys who are smarter than the humans is just weirdly satisfyingly and fun.

Why people would risk getting bitten is beyond me - maybe they think contracting the only traveller illness that is fatal (rabies) is worth it.

"
Australia,"Walked from our bungalow to Monkey
Forest and spent 2+ hours exploring the place with the monkeys roaming free. Lots of sights to see and plenty of photo and video opportunity.

"
Australia,"What a beautiful place for the monkeys to live, they have a lovely home. There are keepers all around the place giving the monkeys food, beautiful trees and statues.
Just one thing to watch is that your bag is closed! My friend had a monkey come up to her take her sunglasses from her bag. We called a keeper over and he threw a banana, and the monkey promptly let go of the glasses and grabbed the banana. At the time it wasn't funny, but we had a good laugh about it afterwards lol.
We noticed an area roped off from the tourists, and the monkeys can go hang out here when they've had enough of us. I really liked that!"
Australia,"Worth the visit when in Bali, however can get pretty busy. Nice new boardwalk and not that expensive to get in. Bathrooms were clean."
Australia,"This time I thought it was a lot better than years ago. In those days, you could buy bananas & peanuts to give to the monkeys - & then they'd climb all over you to get them. These days, they have specific feeding stations & the monkeys are fed twice a day so they don't try to get into your bag like they used to. (in saying that, someone still had their wallet stolen while we were there & when last seen, the monkey was at the top of a very tall tree so you still have to be careful). It's a beautiful, serene walk through the forest. They have done a great job with the walkways & viewing platforms. I could have spent hours there. Lots of babies, loved it."
Australia,Beautiful forest full of monkeys! We opted not to purchase food to feed them as we prefer them to eat what is meant for them naturally. One of the monkeys slipped his hand into a womanâ€™s pocket to steal something so take care. Stunning creatures and really enjoyed our time there.
Australia,"We had a great time visiting here, I even had a small monkey jump on my shoulder and sit for a while and chew on his coconut husk.
the place is well maintained and there are more construction activities upgrading the place constantly
I'd say this a must see when your in Ubud"
Australia,"Monkeys not in cages but free to run and play.

Make sure your bags are zipped closed. One jumped on my bag and was trying to open the zip!

A nice forest and hubby happy to get me out of the shops ðŸ˜†

Do much nicer to see them in a natural environment and can be seen in surrounding street walking on the overhead power wires."
Australia,It was nice to walk around in the forest so central to Ubud. I was shocked to see how many people were trying to touch the monkeys....! Forest was clean and monkeys seemed to behave them selves on my visit.
Australia,"Was a bit concerned about Monkey attacks as I read on trip advisor about some people being bitten. The guides explained what to do and what not to do if approached by a monkey. Remove your sunglasses, carry no water bottles or food, and definately dont try to touch the monkeys. All ok by me! Enjoyed the visit but would not repeat it."
Australia,"A fascinating visit to the home of the monkeys. It still amazes me that despite the clear rules outlined that some tourists continue to be disrespectful and break these (give them food, give them plastic waterbottles) and the monkeys suffer the consequences - and all for their own personal photo opp. We found that if you sat down in a quiet area away from crowds to have a rest, that they naturally approach you because they are inquisitive. I heard people amongst our travels who were anxietious and even scared to visit because of the horror stories, however if you just relax, take a moment, observe them in their enviroment, watch how they interact, be respectful, don't look them directly in the eyes, absorb the privilege of being in THEIR environment and them allowing you to be, then you will add another wonderful memory and experience to your travel adventure"
Australia,"It is not expensive to visit and experience the monkey forest.
The monkeys roam free all around you . If you follow the instructions of the sanctuary, you will have no issues .
They are inquisitive animals , and if you are silly enough to take big shiny bags and sit next the monkeys then they are going to want to look inside and take things . The monkeys then get into trouble from the staff , because you didnâ€™t follow instructions.
There were lots of baby monkeys , very cute . Nice to be able to walk around the sanctuary and watch them play in the trees."
Australia,Definitely the best place to visit in Ubud. Loved seeing the monkeys. They are in a natural habitat not caged in. We saw them eating. They did try and get in a ladies handbag and are naughty if given the chance.
Australia,"Had a lovely stroll through, the monkeys are true characters. Such a nice place, make sure you follow the rules otherwise you will put yourself in danger of being accosted by the monkeys."
Australia,"Had a great 1/2 day at the Monkey Forest. Lots of walking and lots of Monkeys. You need to keep your wits about you and follow the signage, I had no issues with the furry little friends. keep in mind they are very clever and can open zipped bags so be careful. Plenty of photo opportunities too"
Australia,"Very reasonable admission prices but only 40-60 minutes required to walk through. Not a lot there, just a nature walk by a river and a reasonable amount of moneyâ€™s roaming free. Sad to see a scooter path adjacent with the locals buzzing backwards and forwards at speed."
Australia,Lots of monkeys to see but you could see everything just walking around for five minutes. You didnâ€™t really need to see the rest of the park so we only stayed for a short time. Keepers have slingshots to shoot the monkeys when they get rowdy/too close which wasnâ€™t nice to see.
Australia,"It was around a 1 Hour or so walk around the park from the entry. Lots of wild monkeys. Really enjoyed watching them just do their own thing and run around. The baby monkeys are really cute. Its worth the entry fee. Just don't walk around with food or water bottle as such as they will try and steal it. And don't try and touch them, or they will fist fight you and they will win."
Australia,Really enjoyed this and highly recommend to anyone visiting Ubud. Beautiful gardens and lovely to see monkeys happily doing their thing. So many baby monkeys!!! ðŸ˜„
Australia,"There is some mixed reviews on trip advisor for this location. We had an amazing day and weâ€™re so glad we did it. All you need to do is use your common sense and follow the rules. Donâ€™t take food and feed the animals. Patiently leave the monkeys alone and watch them in their habitat.

It was about 8 dollars for an adult entry and I very much would recommend it. Brilliant."
Australia,"If you are staying in Ubud, a must-visit attraction. though most people will go to see the monkeys, it is far more interesting. The walk through a rain-forest is awesome. just to see all the different trees, the waterfall and the stream flowing through the center is worth the visit."
Australia,We arrived in the morning so we could escape the main heat of the day. It is a great place to visit. Just follow the rules and donâ€™t treat the monkeys like a pet. They roam freely and are not afraid of humans. There are staff around to ensure you are kept safe and everyone is friendly. I recommend this to everyone. A great experience. ðŸ‘ðŸ˜Ž
Australia,A highly entertaining couple of hours at the forest but could have spent more time watching the monkeys playing.
Australia,We visited the monkey forest today and it was a fantastic experience. The monkeys are wild so you must be careful of your belongings. However they are so cool to see up close.
Australia,"The park is well aet up and the monkeys are well fed. We followed all the rules and had an incident. It scared my daughter, so entering remembering they are wild animals and if anything happens it is our fault. I had a monkey jump over my daughter and then land on my backpack. Great experience until it started to open the bag. So note to self if we ever did it again would be not to take a bag. Definitely worth a visit."
Australia,Please take care when you go as these monkey's will get into your backpacks and take your sunglasses. Do NOT feed them as this is harmful for them!
Australia,Friendly staff and very welcoming. It's very clean and safe. Wonderful experience. Treasured memories for sure.
Australia,"Very cool place too see all the monkeys, also amazing old trees throughout the park , $5 NZD ($50,000 rupiah) per adult to go in...enjoyed it Thankyou ."
Australia,"It is true that a visit to Ubud is not complete without a visit to the Monkey Forest.
Very cheap to enter and well sign posted. No tour guides are needed as you simply stroll around amongst the monkeys.
Make sure you follow the instructions to keep your bags securely shut as the monkeys have an eye for bags that arenâ€™t. They are cunning thieves

A truly enjoyable family morning.
"
Australia,"Pretty much what it says on the label, its a forest full of monkeys and tourists.

No real dramas, don't show your teeth at the monkeys, don't scream, don't touch them and don't stare and you will be in for a nice walk in a nice forest.

Make sure you watch anything they can grab and dont take food out of your bag.

There are 'keepers' there with slingshots to keep monkeys in line but there are no cages and seems totally ethical"
Australia,"Monkeys are free range so follow the rules and do not bring in food. Great to see them scampering around through the temple grounds.
The facilities are clean and modern.
There is a free shuttle taking you to the main road - no need for expensive tours."
Australia,"Up and off the beaten track is this small, yet amazing Monkey sanctuary. Fair price, just dont go near the monkeys!!"
Australia,Lots of squabbling monkeys scaring tourists - amusing on all sides! Worth walking off the main tracks to see the some of the quieter areas where the monkeys aren't trying to scam food off the rangers
Australia,"You used to be able to buy food for the monkeys. I can understand why they stopped it, monkeys were aggressive. Still a lovely walk through to see the monkeys."
Australia,"Wish I hadn't gone to see the monkeys, they are a shadow of what they would have been in their normal habitat.
Humans have changed their behavior so much that the monkeys have learned to rely on humans too much for food.
The monkeys will grab anything of value (jewelry, phones,wallets) and hold the humans to ransom for food, any food.
I saw a monkey sitting down eating a can of pringles!

I would avoid it if I had known it was going to be like that."
Australia,"Wow, so amazing to see monkey's up close and in such a lovely setting, not overly busy when we went and value for money."
Australia,"Had a great time. Love animals so it was so Nice to see them so free and roaming through the trees.
Watch out for all the monkey poo on the ground but aside from that the park/sanctuary is looked after, tidy and its beautiful to walk through.

Make sure your bag is all zipped up, even though they may try and unzip it (clever things).
DO NOT BRING FOOD. They are super keen and they can smell it from a mile away. Might seem like a fun idea but trust me. When they crawl all over you trying to get it you won't be having fun. ;)

Lots of staff around handy if you need anything or need to report something.

There are couple of entrances to the park. Not sure which one I came through but its all the same. You can look at the map to make sure you cover all the areas."
Australia,"I was advised to...get there early and absolutely correct as when I was leaving the masses were entering. This monkey sanctuary is well maintained with attendants everywhere. Signage is excellent and if you abide by their instructions the monkeys will not bother you. Lovely forest with a lot of statues and stone carving objects. Not a large park but if you take your time and watch them it is very entertaining. And as one reviewer on here said.....'x' rated at times but that's just monkeys business!
There are spotlessly clean toilets and a cafe to grab a coffee/food. So overall a nice enjoyable visit to see the monkeys in their habitat."
Australia,An interesting walk from the Ubud Palace. It is a real tourist rap but fun to do. You have to watch these creatures- they are everywhere and can pounce at any time. great fun photographing them!
Australia,This monkey forest is done in a way that is very much in harmony with nature. Itâ€™s an enjoyable experience with well fed monkeys. I was a bit scared of the monkeys being aggressive but they pretty much leave you alone - I guess provided you are calm and donâ€™t take food in with you!
Australia,"Well run and very cool if you like monkeys. Sit down near them and the young ones will come up to you and jump up on you. Donâ€™t wear earring, necklace etc as they will rip it off. About 8 nzd to enter so worth it."
Australia,"Really well done - spacious, attractive grounds, lots of monkeys, fun interactions. Not too busy, shame there werenâ€™t any signs giving history of the sanctuary and info about the monkeys.
"
Australia,"We loved our visit to the Monkey Forest Property.
A very well designed monkey sanctuary & they seem very happy in their surroundings.
We spent about 1-2 hours there.
There are many toilets throughout the sanctuary and they are exceptionally good condition & very clean.
As it was a really hot day we got the free shuttle (every 15 minutes) from outside the Royal Palace on the main street to the Monkey Forest but unfortunately on leaving we waited for over an hour for the shuttle and gave up in the end and walked out to street for a taxi."
Australia,Great way to escape the streets and go for a nice walk in nature. Cool to watch the monkeys in a relaxed environment
Australia,"I was skeptical about visiting the Sacred Monkey as have heard the monkeys can jump on you. Trick is not to have food on you and then you will be fine. I really enjoyed my visit, it was incredible to see all the monkeys in such close proximity. Would recommend and would go again!"
Australia,"The Sacred Monkey Forest is a great way to get up close to the monkeys. Lots of monkeys running around and plenty of photo opportunities. Just make sure you follow the rules and you will have a great time

The monkeys keep their distance from you however if you want them to sit on you etc then the guides will help with this safety. You can wander around at your own pace and stay as long as you like. Very cool experience and nice to see the mo keys being looked after and not exploited in cages like we did see in other areas"
Australia,Really inpressive! Monkeys are so friendly. I was worries about them being aggressive or jumping on you but this wasn't the case. Really amazing forest with temples inside. Lots of monkeys to see. Highly recommend a visit here.
Australia,"A nice place to spend a few hours at most. Lovely forest setting with nice walkways and temples to see as well as the monkeys. I was pretty safe with my belongings but saw plenty of people there with loose items and sunglasses on their heads!
A large number of monkeys. Lots of babies! And also staff located everywhere keeping an eye on both tourists and monkeys. Feeding spots best places to get up close to them"
Australia,"Amazing place, very peaceful and beautiful. So so many monkeys. $50,000 rupiah (NZD $5) entry. I think the last entry is at 5pm. Quite a few entrances. Make sure you go around the entire place as I missed the holy spring. The monkeys will climb onto your bags if theyâ€™re transparent or those mesh bags and will try steal anything in reach, make sure your bags are close and closed! Donâ€™t look them in the eye or smile at them. Theyâ€™re so funny playing in the pond! Could watch them for hours!"
Australia,It was very interesting enjoyed it alot would recommend to go and see the monkey forest very open and staff very friendly
Australia,"My husband and I loved our visit to the monkey forest today. Itâ€™s a beautiful place and the monkeys are everywhere. We went with our guide who told us the best things to do to enjoy our visit. Follow the rules and guidelines, give the monkeys their space and youâ€™ll have a very enjoyable visit!"
Australia,"A must-see when in Ubud is the Sacred Monkey Forest (open daily 8.30-6pm)...but please do so with brain fully engaged!
The 10-hectare Monkey Forest has about 700 Balinese long-tailed monkeys. There are also three ancient temples (c.1350) over which the animals have complete domain. Photo opportunities are everywhere.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
BEWARE: it is important to remember you are a VISITOR in the monkeys' home, and they do not fear you. Generally, they won't come close if they don't think you have food, but they will snatch bags containing food. They love to grab plastic bottles, and will climb onto visitors to reach food being held in a hand, even if the food is held above a visitor's head.
So do NOT walk in eating food, or with food visible. Common sense always prevails when near wild animals - they're cute but have sharp teeth!
Note to juvenile teenagers: should a monkey climb on you or grab something, please refrain from high-pitched squealing as it agitates the monkeys...and spoils the serenity for others.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Spending an hour in the blissful coolness of the forest while watching the monkeys is well worth it. Adult entry is a mere IDR 50,000 (about NZD$5)."
Australia,Spent about hour and half wondering around. Went mid afternoon to avoid the agression that happens with the monkeys in the morning apparently. You dont get to feed them. Lots of monkeys everywhere and awesome photo opportunities. Plenty of gorgeous babies around. Large area to cover. Wear comfy shoes and bug spray to avoid getting bitten.. only IDR50000
Australia,"We got here not long after it opened and it was great. It wasn't too hot and there weren't many people so it made our experience a bit more special. So many monkeys! They're so cute and when you go in the morning, most of them are eating or just chilling out which we found great as we were able to get some awesome photos. It's a beautiful forest and sanctuary for these Macaques. I would highly recommend visiting if you can."
Australia,The upgrades since I last visited have improved the overall experience. Plenty of monkeys and photo opportunities.
Australia,Really enjoyed my visit to the monkey forest! Was around $5 AUD to get in. Saw soo many monkeys and had no time limit. Highly recommend as a great thing to do.
Australia,Worth a visit if you are into monkeys. You will definitely see them! We were given great advice by our guide: do not carry drink bottles or have unsecured bags - advice to be followed.
Australia,Would recommend coming here if you are in the Ubud area. Costs 50000 each to get in but we didnâ€™t mind paying this as you get up close to the monkeys and see a lot of them. They are all in a natural environment and are well fed. This is what your entrance fee pays for. Make sure you follow the safety instructions well when you go in as we saw peopleâ€™s water bottles being taken by the monkeys. Great to bring kids to. But hold their hands and stick to the rules. Donâ€™t take food in as they are well fed already. Definitely come here.
Australia,"Really good fun. No shortage of Monkeys. Please be aware that they can be a little unpredictable so I suggest you keep your distance. Great for families. Clean atmosphere, friendly staff"
Australia,"Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary
I really donâ€™t know what to say about this place,itâ€™s full of monkeys that could do stuff if you stared at them,have food in your bags or pockets..... when we were there,some girl fed it a candy bar and a monkey jumped on her..... and the monkey is the bad guy???? Really???
This girl should of been kicked out right on the spot,instead of some official shoeing the monkey away.
Joe average place full of peddlers hovering on and around the entrance.(annoying)
If you want to see Monkeys.... Iâ€™d suggest the zoo."
Australia,"On a hot day in ubud exploring the monkey forest was very worth it as you feel you have escaped the bustling streets for jungle and monkeys.
The monkeys are cheeky so don't take in food or water, obey the rules and you will be fine! I took every precaution available to me (bag locked, sunglasses in bag etc) and it was fine, they only bother you if you have food.
Very large space with lots of nature to see.
Monkey are also very cute and healthy.
"
Australia,A little bit wild but good fun to see the monkeys running around. Be aware of the monkeys stealing bottles. They will open them and won't give them back
Australia,"Excellent for a morning walk before it gets too hot.. Lots of monkeys, beautiful temples and walks.. Good value.."
Australia,"Such an amazing experience to see monkeys roaming around freely - eating, sleeping playing etc this is a must do atleast once if ever in Ubud"
Australia,"The monkeys will be up front and in your face. They will climb on you if you let them, and they have been know to remove itâ€™s from visitors and spirit then away. However, having said that, this is a wonderful place to visit if you have an hour or two. Itâ€™s very instructive and entertaining"
Australia,"You will get up and close with monkeys, if you want to you can get them to sit on you. Yes they are cheeky little monkeys, but what do you expect. The temples make great viewing and there is an awesome couple of bridges across a narrow gorge. The price is high but we would go back in a heart beat. Our kids were 6, 8 and 11. Don't take bags, they can get in and definately don't take hats or glasses. The monkeys tried to pick my pocket but it was all good fun. Look for 'guides' with a 'friendly' monkey, for a few K they will give you some food to tempt the monkey to sit on you."
Australia,"Nice area created for these monkeys. You can see the park and the monkeys are well looked after. There is a temple inside also which is pretty. There are photo opportunities with staff keeping the monkeys under control, they will sit on your shoulder but you pay about $2 for this. Just keep hold of your personal items and donâ€™t feed them."
Australia,"We went early and there was no one there, it was lovely. I couldn't believe it. But by the time we left it was heavily populated!!! it was a bit crowded. Monkeys have the chance to leave if they like. But why don't you put the sick blind monkeys in the cage to sleep, put them out of their misery?"
Australia,"I've been to Monkey forest 6 years ago, 3 years ago and again today. Previously entrance was free and you would but bags of nuts to feed to the monkeys. The monkeys would climb on you and grab the nuts from your hands to eat, creating excellent experiences and photo opportunities.

It now costs 80,000Rp,which is still cheap at under $10NZD and well worth the entry fee, especially if you've never been before. If you have been before and fed the monkeys in the past, its still good just not as good as previously."
Australia,"A lovely park to visit in centre of Ubud, where loads of monkeys roam free. Can get excellent shots of the monkeys. Some tourists a little silly around them, donâ€™t bring any food or they will seek it out without hesitation. Put away any thing you donâ€™t want to loose and donâ€™t drop your water bottle - even saw a monkey trying to eat one (taken from money when alerted ranger) A lot of park rangers on hand to keep watch on the monkeys and silly tourists. An enjoyable walk and even saw babies so cute."
Europe,It was really nice to visit this place! Monkeys were not aggresive at all and very familiar with people...i think if u just follow the rules you wont gace any negative experience
Europe,Great opportunitity to get close to the monkeys and a nice jungle walk. Great photo opportunities! The staff working there are very friendly and gentle with the animals.
Europe,It is close to Ubud market and centre. Nice to get out of the scoarching sun. Playful monkies and nice photo opportunities.
Europe,"We had a good time strolling through the beautiful forest in the company of the monkeys who were curious about the visitors but very tranquil. I would recommend visiting, I think it could be especially fun for children."
Europe,Full of people but still shady and peaceful. The monkeys are a joy to watch and the temples and carvings are amazing. Please be respectful of the animals. We are the intruders.
Europe,The Monkey look very healthy. Everythink there is very nice an natural eventhoug there are some streets outside the monkeyforest the areal is quite big and they can move arlund where ever the want. Loved it.
Europe,"You walk through a forest populated by monkeys. They come close, but be careful not to approach them by yourself, or else they might get aggressive."
Europe,"Spent there about an hour, friendly staff, friendly monkeys. Loved the trees & temples. Please read the instructions!"
Europe,"Interesting place to visit, many monkeys are here, many of them are very lazy, some of them can follow you during your trip at the forest.
Be careful with your things, don't carry much with you (sunglasses, cap, etc.) because they can steal something. Don't eat anything because monkeys are permanently triggered at food. Don't feed them because you can be attacked by them if you don't give them all that you have. They have feed places and get enought food from the staff.

Be careful, don't feed monkeys and don't look into their eyes, don't focus your attention too much on them, just enjoy their life and don't disturb them."
Europe,"I went here at 1pm. Pics and videos in internet look amazing, but the reality is far from my expectation. The entrance is way too expensive for this kind of attraction."
Europe,"Fun visit and must do when in Bali. Monkeys are cute and they get quite close. Quite touristic, but worth the visit."
Europe,Itâ€™s a nice walk in the forest with unexpected behaving monkeys. Beware of your belongings. Maybe a little expensive.
Europe,"Just a lot of fun watching the monkeys play in the trees. Don't look in their eyes and leave bags in the car, then you won't have any problems with them.

The park itself is really beautiful!

We love it"
Europe,"Its a nice habitat for monkey, they get alot food. Nice visit. Had alot of fun, nice staff and crazy monkeys.ðŸ™ˆ So much fun."
Europe,"Agresive monkeys. I have been bitten by suprise. (Attacktde from the back)
I needed 3 stitches and 3 shots in local hospital."
Europe,"Modern new entrance to the Forrest; pleasant walk but beware of the monkeys, just follow the rules and do not try to feed them."
Europe,At first I was afraid for the monkeys but they were sweet and kept a distance to the people themselves. Really worth a visit.
Europe,You must like these monkeys a lot or do not visit this because they are everywhere. Do not look them in the eyes!! Beautiful scenery.A must do when visiting Ubud.
Europe,"Come early as the crowd ruins the experience. Must do when you are in Ubud. Be careful with food and drinks, the monkeys steal everything."
Europe,We had a great time here. Lots of Monkeys. We took a lot of great pictures. We will visit the forest again next week.
Europe,"Really worth the visit, stunning place. The monkeys were adorable, seemed happy and free. We followed directions about how to act but we saw several people were not and there just doesnâ€™t seem to be enough guards. Monkeys will climb on you and try to open bags and reach in your pockets. I had my phone in my hand but it didnâ€™t interest them thankfully so I got loads of photos.

At one point we sat in a sort of arena area, guards were present. One younger male monkey wandered up to me and started fiddling with the drawstring of my trousers. I obviously didnâ€™t touch him but I also avoided any sudden movements and just allowed him to get bored which he did. He then went on to my son who was naturally a little more nervous. The monkey was clearly being playful, reaching down and giving him leaves and a rock, and resting his head on him. Whilst avoiding any sudden movements, my son pulled away slightly and I think the monkey, partly out of play partly to stop him from going, grabbed his arm and bit him. I say bit him, but he didnâ€™t really bite, he didnâ€™t even pierce the skin, it was more of a play bite. Obviously we gently shooed the monkey away and immediately went to find one of the guards who had noticed... nothing. I explained what had happened and instead of directing us to first aid, he then asked us what we had done for him to bite us. Eventually he said that there was no reason for us to go to first aid and then turned away and told everyone in the arena to get up and move away.

I thought his attitude was ridiculous. In the end we made our own way to first aid and the woman there was super understanding, really nice and informative. Even though we were both already vaccinated, she disinfected the area as a precaution. We were much more reassured. All the rest of the staff we had interactions with were lovely."
Europe,"A nice forrest full of monkeys, great place to visit! watch your belongings. very busy, everybody wants to go"
Europe,"Support the monkey sanctuary with a visit to this place.
Located in a forest on the outskirts of Ubud center (we walked there, no need for a taxi) you find this reservation where several social groups of monkeys live, (1300 animals when we where there). The animals aren't bothered by the people visiting and continue about their day and they seem well cared for, with respect to natural group dynamics.

There is also an exhibition on the premise (modern art when we visited) as well as some Balinese traditional sites, such as a temporary burial site for local people awaiting a traditional cremation.

On the risk of being bitten; follow the rules and don't be an idiot. These are semi wild animals, don't try to pet them, don't flaunt around with food. They know the sound a wrapper makes, even if it's in your backpack.
DON'T FEED THEM ON YOUR OWN,

Some of the caretakers will offer you some (supervised) interaction for a small fee (20k rupiah) with the animals, like feeding them mais from your hand, which is a fun experience.

Beautiful location for a walk, especially if you like monkeys."
Europe,"An absolute must see on your trip to Ubud. Apart from the monkeys, the architecture is stunning and the forest surroundings are breath-taking. Nicely arranged, clean. I suggest you do not feed monkeys to avoid any inconvenience. Staff is around very helpfull.Keep the monkeys away from you. Just respect the rules and enjoy."
Europe,"As my granny says: let us go to zoo so the monkeys see us as we think we go to see them.

The forest is magical with all the monkeys around. Be well prepared and organized not bringing any jewelry and item hanging on you.

Feel free to get close for a quick shot and do not get too friendly to them.

And have fun!"
Europe,"It might get dangerous and it does. Monkeys get aggressive, attack people and steal whatever they could grab. The gueards find it difficult to manage them."
Europe,"A nice park, though serving as a natural monkey habitat. Can't call it exceptional as we had freely-walking monkeys in our hotel, as well, so something usual in Bali. Beware that some of the animals might be aggressive, but overall friendly and accustomed to men presence."
Europe,"The forest is gorgeous and the atmosphere is amazing. Monkeys are kind if you do not disturb them too much. Getting close to baby monkey with mums coe to them could be dangerous.
Note please that taking pictures with monkey on yours should while feeding them under the supervision of a staff member can be charched."
Europe,"As a tourist attraction I highly recommend visiting Monkey Forest in ubud. A beautiful ""jungle"" in Ubud with lots of little paths leading you to the temple, river balcony with a wiew and ofcourse a large number of monkeys. They ate fed several times aday from different places in the park and it brings the smile to everybody to be able to watch them so closely. Only one type of monkeys, but the come in all sizes and ages and its really interesting to watch them. Remember to put on mosquito-repellant as its an are with shadow and a river and you will leave with several bites if you ate not protected."
Europe,"We went with two kids aged 4 and 9. They thought it was a fun experience and us parents thought it was good and beautiful.

Be aware of your kids as some monkeys is very aggressive.

Recommened to take the free transfer back to the palace. We didnt know about it before asking about something else at the information desk."
Europe,"Had great fun in Monkey Forest. Nice to see monkeys out of captivity. There were 1000+ monkeys there. If you follow the guidelines, you should be perfectly safe. Donâ€™t tease or provoke the animals, as we saw some people do. A good laugh for children to visit the place."
Europe,"When you enter the forest there are monkeys everywhere. Itâ€™s fantastic how u are so close to wild monkeys. They respect you, so you have to respect them too. But they can be very curious,, sometimes they get on you. The forest is also amazing with multiple temples and a river! A very good experience for families. U should see this if u are in Ubud."
Europe,"The park is very nice.

The monkeys ability to smell food is amazing. I had a small plastic back in my backpack and one of the monkeys jumped onto my back, opened my backpack and took my plastic back.
"
Europe,"Go to the forrest and visit the animals - Remember that you are visiting Them - in their forrest - behave !
Be attentive, for the monkey Night areal your sunglasses pr otter items - they are quick ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚"
Europe,"Definitely a must when visiting Ubud, monkey all over the place and you can really get close to them. But do beware and follow guide lines shown all over the park."
Europe,"We were debating whether to skip the Monkey Forest or not due to the bunch of negative reviews regarding the aggressive monkeys. However, that was not our experience at all. The monkeys walked, played, relaxed and slept peacefully as we explored the beautiful forest, which looks just like the rainforests on Planet Earth - well except for the pathways.

As long as you follow the recommendations for the park, which is not to bring food or plastic and paper bags into the park, you really shouldn't have any trouble with the monkeys.

We decided to leave everything at home except for our phones and enough cash for the gate, which meant that the monkeys were as indifferent to us, as they could be."
Europe,The park is quite big.. some places remind Tarzans jungle. And the main cute bandits on the area are the monkeys of course
Europe,"At first I was sceptic of going to a place with animals being the attraction, but the park is spacious and the monkeys seem to be doing alright, despite the huge amounts of people visiting. But the behaviour of some people, disrespecting guidelines and animal behaviour, just to get a selfie, still amazes and disappoints me."
Europe,"Really nice place to visit - there are more than 1000 monkeys and they are all over. The monkeys come close to you, but there is always staff around who really know the monkeys, so there is nothing to be worried about.

The forest itself is also very beautiful and well taken care of.

Must-see place in Ubud!"
Europe,"It may look scarier first, but the monkeys are actually quite reasonable, if you are too. Very nice pathways to explore, well needed shade... A perfect morning walk!"
Europe,Usually not big fan to this kind of attractions. This one was made properly and was very nice. You will encounter the monkeys close by. Good signs & roads to walk. No muddy tracks. Totally recommended.
Europe,Such a great experience! A nice walking in the jungle with monkeys. They are nice and friendly and if you behave nice you will be lucky to have a photo with them :) so they just come to you and sit on your shoulder. Definitely recommend!
Europe,Monkeys were friendly. Quite a lot of tourists but I didnâ€™t see monkeys stealing sun glasses etc like in Uluwatu temple. It might be thanks to regular feeding hours. There are instructions not to look monkeys to eyes or try to touch them. Small entarance fees.
Europe,The monkeys were cute but the forest was a bit of a disapointment. Ihad expected it to be more of a wild forest but ut was just like a zoo. A nice experience though.
Europe,"Fun place, we watched while monkies stole a ladies earrings. Fun place and kids will totally enjoy this place too."
Europe,"There is renovation going on.
Monkees were peacefull and there is lots of signs to tell you how to behave there.
Great place for kids and adults."
Europe,"We almost decided to pass this place, so tourist trap the name sounds, but NO! Do Go!

This really was a nice place!

Two reasons:

* the monkeys are funny fellows to watch
* and, take the secret path right to the bottom of the monkey forest valley! Totally unique ambience there!"
Europe,"A very nice park with cute monkeys. It is, however, very touristic and not as authentic as I hoped it would be."
Europe,"Harmony and peace. Beautiful place and really a must visit. Eco cafe. *****-stars, just amazing heaven."
Europe,We had a really nice day with monkeys there! The area itself was big and clean and the monkeys had a lot of space and different places to go. Big + for the fact that there were strickt rules for not touching and feeding the animals!
Europe,"Monkey Forest is a peaceful place to meet monkeys without being afraid for our belongings. Monkeys are so cute and funny !!! We loved this place !!!

Unfortunately, we arrived a bit late (5:15 pm) and had less than 45 minutes in the forest, that's a bit short. But we enjoyed it a lot !!!"
Europe,"It was a fun experience to do, the monkeys are really everywhere! 1 hour there is enough to enjoy the place and see the monkeys play."
Europe,Ok visit. Good to spend 1-2 hours stroll. Monkeys are still wild and unpredictable and not friendly. There are lots of guards around though some are there just to make money from tourists.
Europe,"
very clean and well organised but not enough things to do inside except walk around monkeys.
Nice walks thought"
Europe,"We were expecting to find monkeys in their natural environment.
The forest was here, but also all of the employees feeding the monkeys all day long to keep them close to the tourists and even making them coming for the pictures.
They were not wild anymore."
Europe,"For anyone who wants to see monkeys, this is a good spot in Ubud. Itâ€™s 80k/adult, 2 hours are enough to visit the site.
Prefer early hours to avoid the crowd.
"
Europe,"Obviously if you don't like places with tourists you will be disappointed.
Still I personly loved this place where ypu can see monkeys leaving in their natural environment and you could spend hours wartching them."
Europe,I am not a big fan of Monkeys but I guess it is a must to do while in family. Entree fee is 80K per person.
Europe,Strange forest not far from the town. Be careful monkey can be agressive! Do not look at them in the eyes.
Europe,"Really disappointing... looks like Disney land :-(
more tourists that monkeys ! LoL
You may want to go there for an easy walk with your young kids...
otherwise, just skip it !"
Europe,"Very beautiful place with luxury vegetation. But please please please be careful about the monkeys. Especially with children.
Monkeys are disturbed by visitors and donâ€™t react like they would alone in the forest. Even though they seems friendly and funny ( climbing on shoulders / looking in bags for goodies etc) they are very stressed and can bite or scratch you without warning.
I was on my knee taking picture of young monkeys about 20m away from them and still one of them ran towards me and jump on me starching my upper leg. I was not stress at first but they can have the rage even though employee from the monkey forest will tell you the opposite. When I got home I went to the Pasteurâ€™s institute in Paris and they treated me against the rage just in case. Doctors there were quite upset about this place in Ubud. They said many people come for treatment after bites or starches form the monkeys there. Doctors asked me to report this on media network and informed people to be very careful when visiting this place or even better to avoid it.
I can understand that for everyone the monkey forest is a must see in Ubud but please always remember to keep a Â« safe Â» distance from the monkeys and donâ€™t let them climb on your shoulders or grab your personal belongings.
"
Europe,"Monkeys' hilarious antics are not no be missed. The park is huge and a nice place to walk. The overall variety plants, traditional buildings, etc. makes it even more worthwhile.
Caution is much needed, though. I know at least one person - a Balinese - who was hear the forest, when he was bitten by a monkey, without a slightest provocation from his side. Needless to say the bite was nasty and became infected at some point. Thus, monkeys being easily overexcited, they definitely are not to be provoked in any manner - especially by showing them food you have no intention of parting with"
Europe,"Itâ€™s not really objective opinion unfortunately, but for me it was not really pleasant visit. I was really scared about monkeys just jumping around and even jumping on people. Locals were repeating all the time to be careful, but tourists didnâ€™t care... they thought itâ€™s funny etc but it was not really cool to trying to get attention of monkeys for nice pic or to laugh. However I have to admit that the forest itself is amazing."
Europe,"A nice place to see Free Monkey. They aren't in cage and move as they want that let us walk through their habitation, were you see them play, eat and sleep.
The place is clean and in low season, you are not walking on someone else space"
Europe,What a wonderful experience. You are in the city and in the middle of all this you have a nice forest with lots of monkeys running in the wild. I was lucky when I visited there were baby monkeys everywhere. The place seems wild but all is well kept up and clean. The monkeys look healthy and happy. It is great to be able to wonder for hours if you wish and watch all the monkeys in their habitat.
Europe,you can smell the monte trine everywhere. quite overrated. One thing though the road to town you can walk and if full of goodies and restos.
Europe,"It was a great experience! Monkeys so close up, with cute little babies, in their own natural forest. The guards are ready to intervene if necessary; funny also watching the other tourists mesmerizing...fooling around; you wonder what the monkeys could think of us? Even though there have been quite a lot of people, there is a lot of space in this forest. You certainly wonâ€™t regret the experience.
"
Europe,"It's full of tourists - but you will have some monkey fun anyway. And some nice photos of cause! But be aware, if they climb in you they want something..."
Europe,"I've been there with my girlfriend during our visit of Ubud. Mixed feelings, the price is ok, the forest is really nice, the monkeys are generally speaking friendly and funny. The problem was that a couple of monkeys tried to open my backpack and steal the content, when my girlfriend tried to send them away they almost bit her. This happend multiple times again during our staying there, probably simply recommending to leave all backpacks out of the forest is enough to make it more enjoyable"
Europe,A beautiful place and a really cool experience! Would absolutely recommend to anyone going to the area.
Europe,"Although the monkeys managed to steal a badge off my backpack, I need to rate this place 5/5 points. Itâ€™s so entertaining to watch the monkeys jump around. Good for a short visit while in Ubud, as itâ€™s not far away."
Europe,"Fun experience! Can be done in a couple of hours. The monkeys are used to the ppl but donâ€™t get too close. Some can be a bit aggressive or at a minimum thieves ðŸ˜… donâ€™t have anything loose that they can grab from you, unless you wanna loose it. Donâ€™t worry though. Thereâ€™s keepers all over the park to keep you safe ðŸ˜‰"
Europe,"The temple and forrest are nice and behold: there are monkeys (lots and lots of them), but: the monkeys are aggressive and one should really, really mind the safety instructions. We saw ourselves that a toddler was bitten violently by a monkey (parents didnâ€™t stick to the safety instructions and put the kid directly next to the monkey for a good picture...) - monkeys can transfer rabies! The personell is very friendly and helpful and constantly remembers the visitors to take care."
Europe,"Nice forest, nice monkeys and pushy photographers.
If you ever wanted to play with monkeys (makaki) go there. Just bring some peanuts (whole, not roasted), offer them one and in a second they will be on you - on your shoulders or even head.
Do not provoke them or smile on their face. Also, dontâ€™t show them your teerh, itâ€™s a sign of aggresion."
Europe,"We spent one hour there but easily could have spent more time. We would recommend not taking any valuables or backpacks of any kind since we saw quite a few people getting robbed. The monkeys know how to open water bottles, zips on backpacks and mosquito sprays. We saw some monkeys stealing and eating chewing gum which is of course really bad for them. The monkeys also jumped on us a couple of times which wasnâ€™t as scary as it looked. I would definitely go there again!"
Europe,There are many moneys in this forest and they mostly get used to with the visitors..Try not to walk alone with food.
Europe,"We went to the Monkey Forest in the morning just after opening hour, so it was not too warm and the monkeys were still relaxed. The temples in the park are beautiful and it is a lot of fun to watch the monkeys play. I do not recommend to feed the monkeys or to approach them too closely if you are afraid of being touched or even jumped by them."
Europe,Not so bad. Absolutely new experience. Please to be careful. The monkey so clever - they can open your rucksacks to looking for some interesting!!!
Europe,"There are quite a lot of people going there, but the area is quite large. So it is ok. There are a lot of monkeys. Be careful: They try to steal everything and even open bags. The temples are also very impressive. In the centre there is also some art exhibition. Definitely a must go, when you are in Ubud."
Europe,"Visited this place as a part of our tour. At first we were a bit hesitating, as it was very sunny hot day, however inside the forest there is a lot of shadows and it is pretty comfortable.

There are a lot of monkeys of a different age running around, some are curious and some are lazy. If you follow the rules and do not disturb the monkeys or show some agression to them - they are friendly and do not really care about you, unless you have some snack :). There are a lot of employees around, which feed the monkeys or even play with them.

To sum up, it is a recommended place for a walk even in a hot day! Tropical forest is great!"
Europe,"Always fun to walk around the monkey forest. It's nice walking around in there for 1-2 hours watching the monkey doing their thing. Fun for every age, young and old!"
Europe,"I was surprised by the monkey forest. Not only that you can see free living monkeys - living there by choice, not by force - the place is well run and clean. It was sad to see a lot of tourists bringing plastic bottles and therefore polluting the area. The monkeys might be curious from time to time and steal stuff. If you keep that in mind and keep your belongings in your bag, nothing will happen. But some of the tourists take out stuff on purpose to provoke the monkeys and get the best picture. Stupid humans! Nevertheless, or better thankfully the staff is keeping it very clean! And the monkeys are lovely to watch! They are very calm and ignore you - most of the time. What I loved most is, that you cannot buy water in plastic bottles and they have recycled straws. That's a good spirit! There are souvenir shops, but not too many and you aren't forced or being talked/pushed into buying something. I was happy to see that they kept and healed two injured monkeys. They take care of them and keep them close to the other monkeys - in cages for their own safety. But as the cages are very small, I need to give only 4 stars. I would be so happy, if they had more space. I hope they will change that in the future."
Europe,"During our stay in Ubud we went to the monkey forest. The forest is huge and offers an ideal home for the monkeys. Since there is so much space, the monkeys can retreat even if the mob of the visitors becomes too big. I think that's very good for the animals! The complex offers beautiful corners and adventures. I felt very comfortable and was able to take great pictures. The highlights were the monkeys and the selfie and the great big trees as well as the whole place haha :D. The caretakers are very nice, helpful and make sure that all rules are obeyed and that the monkeys are safe from the tourists. Very nice!!! You need to visit this place ;-)"
Europe,Great experience to see the monkeys that close. The employees had nice tricks that it looks like the monkey is doing a selfie with you! Definitely worth a visit if you are not scared of monkeys!
Europe,"Nice forest ,the monkeys are in good condition.If you are tired and have to sit somewhere ,propably a monkey will climb on your shoulder,dont scare ,stand up slowly and walk.The only thing that i have lost fotunately ,was a hair clasp,because the monkey tried to pull it over my head."
Europe,"A very nice visit to this unique place.

If someone wants to visit this place they can have the visit even in the afternoon because the humidity of jungle helps a lot and the visitors cannot be annoyed because of the high temperatures.

It is a very big park with greenery landscapes, bridges and amphitheatrical parks with different exotic Balinese architectural buildings. Another good choice to have a contact with nature.

Monkeys can be observed and got in touch with humans but we should not forget that are not pets but wild animals. Visitors should respect their natural environment/park. They should not have an eye contact and not feed them. It is a good idea not to have valuable jewels on them because they can be stolen by the monkeys.

"
Europe,The place is awesome. So many monkeys in there physical area. You can see mothers with small monkeys and other big male. We saw and 2 komodo dragon.
Europe,Very nice park in the centre of Ubud! In my opinion it is the highlight of Ubud! Too many monkeys to see and take pictures! Worthy of visit! Ps. Watch out for the monkeys...they steal!
Europe,"I guess itâ€™s kind of mandatory to go there when in Ubud but there are lots of places to see monkeys in Bali, and also free. If you plan to visit Uluwatu temple you will see plenty of monkeys there too. Too many tourists, nothing sacred about it, lots of monkeys."
Europe,Its amazing experience.!!!You must visit monkey forest if you are in Bali.!!!It has so many monkeys.!
Europe,"Lots of staff around, especially around the feeding areas. Nice to see the monkeys in their natural habitat rather than in a cage or zoo.

There are a few stairs so be aware of you have a buggy or wheelchair. Keep an eye behind you in case you have a cheeky monkey following you!
"
Europe,"Lovely tropical garden, easy to go, well organized and set, with many funny monkeys that become cheeky sometimes. Not something extraordinary of'course but a joy to visit and spend about an hour..."
Europe,"An absolutely Must Do in Bali. The Forest is amazing and the most great part is the happy, free monkeys that live there."
Europe,"If you ever visit Bali do not miss the monkey forest.
It s a huge jungle with charmy
Monkeys, the ticket is only 50k idr."
Europe,"A lovely two hours walk in the jungle, surrounded with many cute monkeys. This visit is a must when you visit the area. Donâ€™t miss it!"
Europe,Great place. At first you might feel a little bit worried and scared and you must be very attentive but you must visit this place
Europe,"It is very nice place to see the monkeys and the nature .
You can spend there at least 2 hours walking and watching the life of monkeys .

Be careful with bags or bottle of waters since monkeys may jump up to you to take them (they are not beating however this may make you feel uncomfortable)"
Europe,"Beware of the sign in front of the entrance, there said everything you must know before go inside.
My experience was great! If you afraid of monkeys, dont go. We dont have to hear your screaming and you scare monkeys and that can have unpredictable results.. Monkeys trying to open your bags to find food, so beware of your bags. Dont give them nothing, they are experts inside that take care of them. Enjoy your ride inside the forrest, its beautiful."
Europe,"We were here in March 2019, and liked it very much. Monkeys are cute, luckily they didnâ€™t try to climbed on us or bite us ðŸ˜ƒ
The entrance fee is valid, it was worth it ðŸ™‚"
Europe,"Overall is a place that you should not miss. Don't expect too much, the place is not small, not huge, monkies are here and there doing what monkies do, sometimes interacting with tourists, sometimes just minding they own daily routines. Definitely worth checking, you can leave with some nice pictures and good memories."
Europe,"Though it was fun to see the monkeys in theyre habitat, they are really aggressive if they dont get what they want, they go berserk. We had a backpack that they jumped up on and tried to open it. When i tried to stop them they went full on attack mode and there was no employee in sight. But all together it was kind of nice."
Europe,"Fun to watch all the Monkeys play, eat and watch out for each others. Make sure to not wear glasses or hold something in your hands, ie a bottle, the Monkeys can take it from you!"
Europe,Not to expensive. Beautiful forest and monkeys everywhere in their natural habitat. They are not aggressive.
Europe,"We had a great time in the Monkey Forest.
The place was absolutely full of tourists, but still enjoyable. It did cause a traffic jam or two on the bridges though.
If you observe all the rules, the monkeys will not bite or harass you in any way.
Even if you are not that into monkeys, you can still enjoy the unique nature and the temples in the forest.
You can go there at midday to escape the heat, but this is also the busiest time."
Europe,"Monkeys everywhere you turn. Maybe it was the time of day we arrived at but a lot of them seemed to be quite aggressive, mainly towards each other. Some great photo opportunities but you also need to be on your guard with the cheeky fellas! Well worth a visit."
Europe,It's a lovely place to spend an hour wandering about. Lots of monkeys and there seemed to be lots of baby ones. The monkeys can be aggressive with each other. Best toilets
Europe,"stunning gardens, and hilarious monkeys, so many of them and so much much fun ...well worth a visit !"
Europe,It is nice to go for 1 or 2 hours visit. Good parking and entrance fee is not too expensive. You canâ€™t give food to the monkeys like before which is much better as I used to drive wrong behaviors.
Europe,"we were worried after hearing about monkey thefts and as we arrived heard a shout as one monkeys took off with a wallet. lovely to see them in beautiful sourroundings. Some foolhardy people trying to feed them. however the guide said, bring nothing but your camera/phone dont put your hands in your pockest and you'll be fine ..We were! worth a visit sorry we didnt have longer."
Europe,"Great to see all the monkeys so relaxed around all the tourists! Be careful as they will steal anything from you eg glasses, cameras, phones etc but I was told if you offer them something else (food), that will trade with you !"
Europe,I went in together with husband and my guide/driver who protected me from the monkeys - other people where not so lucky - one woman lost her camera when a monkey took it and never was found again. Best time to visit is early morning.
Europe,It wasnt very big and it felt very man made. Maybe visit another one. Monkeyâ€™s were fighting a lot. We stayed away from them.
Europe,"Wonderfull place, worth visiting. Lots of monkeys that can be v cheeky so u have to be careful not to have anything out of your bag/ backpack as u might lose it."
Europe,"This was such a fun activity. I absolutely loved going into the sanctuary and it has so many lovely scenery spots. The trees are amazing and of course the monkeys are fab.

My trip unfortunately had to be cut short as I was feeling very sick. Will definitely be going back for another look see!

The sanctuary could use maybe more information boards on the monkeys themselves? Just to educate people a bit more. Other than that, they seemed happy out."
Europe,"Gorgeous setting, animals are fearless due to the footfall of tourists. Seemed happy and in reasonable condition but lot looked over weight. Probably fed excessively to keep them down on the ground and out of the trees for people to photograph. Still as someone who works with animals, I must say this place seemed eco friendly, well signposted and really well staffed. Plenty of facilities as well. Could do with a few more information signs about the animals themselves given they are the main attraction. Most signage seemed to refer to the temples. Don't miss it if you're staying in Ubud"
Europe,"Worth the trip, was a bit scared of the monkeys, make sure you dont bring any food or even water bottles they rob off you, but its a good experience and so cheap to go in"
Europe,"Wow!crazy monkey will enjoyed our walk inside this forest! Be careful with your smartphone and sunglasses, i saw monkeys stolen also cigarettes from tasks!"
Europe,"A very amazing excursion!
Wecould feed directly the monkeys, but, take care! They are very spiteful and able to take yor glasse or easly open your bags. Local personnel is very good and let you familiarize soon with the monkeys. Strongly suggested with children"
Europe,"Beautiful place, plenty on little monkeys, wild tropical forest, impressive nature.
You will enjoy it unless you are afraid of monkeys.
Worthy.
"
Europe,"Easy day out enjoying cheecky monkeys. Some are aggressive, puppies are curious. Nevertheless don't do like most of the tourists there that tried to touch them. It is a nice park, easy to walk around (if you don't consider the heat and the humidity level). Quite nice though, especially the path that brings you to the bridge envelopped by trees! Quite few people there, so go early if you can."
Europe,"All the monkeys are free, in their habitat, they can go and back when they want. They look happy, healthy and in their own environment."
Europe,This place is a like a theme park with monkeys all around and fake ancient monuments. Monkeys are free but feeded by local people with bananas so they stay in the park and donâ€™t go away. Not a real place but a good chance to see macaques running free and loudly. Pay attention to your belongings because they can also open your backpack!!!
Europe,Realy nice experience in the jungle in the midle of the city Ubud. The monkeys are nice and used to the poeople and the park is nice to see.
Europe,We just had visited this place very recommend this for you place for visit. staff in there really friendly and help for take great selfie picture with monkey
Europe,"The place is beautiful and the monkeys make you feel closer to nature, was also lucky enough to be climbed by a lovely monkey ðŸ˜‚"
Europe,Great sanctuary just few minutes walk from the center of Ubud. many temples. nice monkeys (not as tricky as in other sanctuaries).
Europe,"Such a nice and amusing experience! You litterally enter a jungle and the monkey world... But be careful, they're very smart, gourmand and curious :) don't miss it!"
Europe,There are a lot of monkeys that walk near the tourists. It's an amazing experience because the staff of the forest can take the monkey and make a foto with you
Europe,"I have no photos from the forest as I was afraid of monkeys. They were agressive. And it was written that no glasses, no food etc."
Europe,Was very interesting visit. It was interesting to see the monkey life up close. We saw the graves.With same was interesting to know about funeral traditions.
Europe,"Very nice place to see some monkeys. There is dozens of them. Very safe, when you follow rules. Highly recommended."
Europe,This place is well organised and secure with local folk everywhere making sure the monkeys cause no harm to tourists. Amazing to see such wildlife in a dense forrest. Would definately go again
Europe,We weren't expecting much but this place was fun. Its an easy walk and it will occupy you for a few hours. There are rules you must follow but the monkeys are friendly but beware your belongings.
Europe,"Cheap entrance to this cool jungle where the monkeys live. This is a must see, but if you are afraid of the monkeys I would recommend to see them live in the streets before entering the forest to get more familiar with them."
Europe,"The monkey forest is a beautiful track along a river valley. The track is very nice and you get close up to plenty of monkeys. There are guards everywhere overlooking the animals. The monkeys can happen to jump on you so take care of belongings and put bottles inside your bag. Overall it seems to be a quite good conservation project going on there, all though some tourists we saw tried to touch the monkey babies (which is not a good thing)."
Europe,"My fiancee and I loved walking around seeing all of these amazing monkeys. The first thing that happened was that a man sitting on a bench got bit by a large male, so we did not quite know what to expect.
The hours spent in this forest were amazing. We loved just walking around watching the animals interact with each other. The scenery is also very special excluding the monkeys. There are quite a few places to sit down and relax. Several monkeys climbed on us by the end of the day, but non of them where agressive.
Monkeys will climb on you if you are wearing a backpack. There was also a guy who charged 50000 IDR to feed the monkeys banana on your shoulder. It was probably not legit, but we enjoyed it all the same.
The staff were always watching to make sure that the monkeys behaved. We had to remind ourselves to put down the camera and enjoy the moment seeing as there were too many picturesque moments.
"
Europe,"Based on being told it was a big temple in Ubud and a must visit, I was a bit disappointed. But the monkey's gave us good entertainment and it was nice to walk around and see the different status, the beautiful forest and all the monkeys and their babies."
Europe,"I read several warnings in regards of bringing children here. As long as the children are calm and dont fiddle with anything, it's safe. I didnt allow my oldest to approach them, shout at them and so on. Our 10 month old was in a carrier,

Must add that you dont just come here for the monkeys. The jungle and sorroundings in itself is a beautiful experience. I hope to return!

Obs: Dont put your bag on the ground!"
Europe,"This is truly an amazing place. Iâ€™ts an ancient tempel site with forest and wild monkeys. The place is absolutely stunning.
and definitely worth the trip. Note that the monkeys are wild and that it is a sacred place, so be respectful."
Europe,"This park is a must if you are in Ubud!!! I really didn't expect to find a place so well maintained and clean. There is hundreds of monkeys inside but also many guards. It's very important to don't look the monkeys in the eyes (they feel you want to fight them) or give them food. Very important also is to keep everything inside your backpack and hold firmly your camera if you have one. They can try to take it from you.
Sayed so just enjoy the beautiful nature, the river, the temples and from time to time the squirrels and the beautiful colored birds ðŸ˜Šâ¤ï¸"
Europe,Had an amazing time in the monkey forest saw loads of monkeys doing there thang even had a few climb up on my shoulders was loads of fun a must see in ubud
Europe,"We donâ€™t have monkey were we are from so this was a really fun experience for me and my friend!
The scenery was fantastic and there were so many monkeys. I didnâ€™t have to look for them, they were everywhere.
I really recommend this if you only have a few days in Bali.
"
Europe,"Not fare from the hotel; it looked more like a garden area, - there the monkeys were waiting for us :) Some hands full of peanuts changed hands and a lot of pics was taken - everybody happy. Thank you so much. :) No problems at all, friendly and cute."
Europe,"If you are in Ubud, the monkey forest is ""a must.""
The monkeys are cute, and it's nice to see that they are well taken care of. There is lots of staff around the forest feeding the monkeys and making sure everything is ok.

But do beware: the monkeys are wild animals. It is adviced to stay at a safe distance, don't feed the monkeys, and don't bring food, candy etc. inside the forest (even in your bag or your pockets) as the monkeys will smell it and try to steal it."
Europe,This place is really nice and monkeys are so lovely. They donâ€™t care about you unless you bother them. Staff is nice and helps you with getting cool photos.
Europe,"The monkey forest is a must see attraction in Ubud.

It s very economic entry and it offers almost an hour of jungle views and monkeys.

You can really feel the savage and sometimes is even little scary with all those monkeys around.

Better not to wear anything flashy !"
Europe,"If you live monkeys you MUST visit monkey forest! Theyâ€™re very where! Large, medium, and baby monkeys in heir â€œnaturalâ€ habitat

The sanctuary is home to over 750 monkeys along with beautiful ancient walls, statues, and temples.

The jungle vibe is great for photos and walking.

West comfortable shoes and bring water as thereâ€™s a surprising amount of stair climbing and walking/ roaming to be done!"
Europe,"Located walking distance from the city center offers deep jungle experience. Tons of monkeys, which try to still some food from you - so be careful. Entry fee approx US$2-3."
Europe,When you think of Ubud - this place is the first thing that comes to mind. We had a quick look even though the place was pretty crowded with tourist (they closed off half of the forest for observation purposes). The monkeys were decently behaved but we enjoyed the beautiful forest more. Come in the early morning as it gets extremely hot and humid.
Europe,It is definitely worth visiting even though the entrance tickets are quite expensive. Masses of tourists make this place little less charming.
Europe,"I was a bit scared to go, since some of my friends who visited similar places in Bali said that the monkeys are out of control :) and they can jump on you or steal stuff from you... but none of this happened. Granted, I was being a very ""good tourist"" since I was scared lol so I would not engage them of course, I wouldn't wear anything shiny or anything they could take away from me - like sunglasses. You should be careful thought, I did see monkeys jump on a girl's back pack so... Nonetheless, it is a interesting experience, the forest is gorgeous, it's fun to see monkeys walk around, there are few beautiful spots in the forest, like temples, statues, bridges, etc. There's also a building where they have temporary exhibitions. You can easily spend at least half a day in there, walking around."
Europe,Nice place to go and stay up to 2 hours. Friendly staff and awesome views on nature and monkeys of course
Europe,"You can watch the monkeys in natural habitat, eating, sleeping and have fun together, in a beautiful place prepared for them. Amazing experience."
Europe,"If you think this would be a great entertainment just forget. This is a forest overcrowded by people upsetting the monkeys.
Nonetheless a member of the staff was asking for a support to the tourist while he was looking around to see if some other members of the staff were not seeing him. After getting the money he just put some food on the tourist hand for the monkey to catch while other was taking the picture. This was absolutely disgusting. What a corruption!!! I thought that money was to conservation issues, but this scenery just destroyed my faith in humanity. Fortunately I have a photo of him. You can see him and report him as I did.

A monkey jumped over my head and tried to open my Bag. My husband tried to save me and was almost bitten by this creature."
Europe,"A good place to go when in UBUD. There are around 750 monkeys in the forest, it seems. But be careful when visiting the place because the monkeys can be quite agressive and bite. Do not take any food of drinks with you."
Europe,"To get there it's not difficult just follow the signs. It's 50.000 IDR per person it's worth it cause I can spend at least 2 to 3 hours walking around swing the monkeys, the forest, river, and nature it self. The monkeys are very peaceful but very very curious so if they smell food in you backpack they will go there."
Europe,"According to the information there are about 900 monkeys in the sanctuary. They live in 6 groups of about 150 each and each group lives in a different area of the park.
The park is very pleasant to walk around and there are monkeys everywhere - they generally ignore the humans, but will poke around in bags that are put down and even climb on people if they think you are carrying food - donâ€™t!
There are also some nice temples, bridges, boardwalks and streams to view. Worth an hour + to explore and not expensive."
Europe,"Enjoyed the walk, so nice and green and really full of monkeys but have to be carefull, the monkeys go to your bag for food"
Europe,Itâ€™s a funny place to visit. You have to be careful with your belongings because monkeys like to keep them. Donâ€™t wear earrings during the visit.
Europe,"Amazing contact with the monkeys, beautiful florest inside Ubud, also notice the butterflies when you are there, they're beautiful. If you are calm enought maybe you can extend a finger so a monkey will ""shake your hand"", but of course be careful. They will jump on you and open your bag without any problem to steal wathever is appealing to them, especially food. Or powerbanks ðŸ˜‚ Without a question a must see while in Ubud."
Europe,"Been there with my boyfriend for about an hour. Is nice to walk around m, has some beautifully temple but you canâ€™t get in, as they are for prayers only. The monkeys are everywhere and you can watch them from very close. Would recommend for the end of the day and then a drink in one of the bars close."
Europe,the monkeys are very funny and some of them are adorable :) A must see when in Ubud ! watch it if you have a bag they might steal it !
Europe,"We had a great experience at the sacred monkey forest. The place was not at all crowded and there were lots of monkeys roaming around in plain sight. After paying the entrance fee, we got a 'monkey guard' assigned to us - he acts as both protector and photographer- I would not go in the forest without one. We didn't want our picture taken (5$ for a polaroid), but he helped us loads with fending off the big monkeys and giving us food to feed the smaller ones - they like peanuts, so come prepared if you want to feed them extra. Careful, monkeys will climb up on your shoulders, or even head, to get the food from you, and they can be heavy - if you do not like it and want them to climb down, just tilt forward slowly and they will go. Also, the guard has a sling with him and he can fend them off if you only want to watch them. We went there with our 4 year-old and she loved having monkeys climb on her so we had a nice experience, but be warned there were other groups who got scared, so this activity not be for everyone."
Europe,"Especially if you have not seen monkeys before, it's a place worth visiting.
Take care of your belongings when you are near the monkeys."
Europe,"I am an animal lover, so for me was Heaven! The monkeys are very cute, they are in their natural habitat, but you must be careful: do not feed them, do not bring food in the forest, avoid eye contact with the monkeys! If you follow the rules and respect the nature, nothing bad will happen to you."
Europe,"Everything was so interesting and funny, the monkeys are just so cute... but not friendly and they steel every object you fail to supervise :))"
Europe,One of the most enjoyable experiences in Bali. Not to be missed by anyone visiting Bali. Also the entire forest and lay of the land is amazing.must see
Europe,"For an eurpean guy, is a very nice experience to walk around monkeys, see them into their own home playing, eating, fighting and more! :)
The moneys are very smart so, you have to be careful with your backpack because they know well to open a zipper and still anything they can.
Most of them are friendly but not count on that too much.
Itâ€™s prohibited to feed them and touch them but this is resonable.
Very nice experience for everyone!
Minus - the park personal is there just to tell you what youâ€™re not alowed what to do and no to increases your experience."
Europe,"Very nice location, lots of monkies walkthrough, wooden paths and geat relaxation visit.

Enjoyed at the most. Be aware not to make eye contact with them, no feed with food and don't wear anything than can be 'stolen' from you by them.(ie: sunglasses)

And the most important, do not touch them, expecially the young ones !

Enjoy!"
Europe,"We had a good time here, wandeding in this park. Many cute monkeys all over the place, but I have not seen any monkey stealing or being aggressive(like in Uluwatu temple). If you have the time and plan to visit Ubud, for sure it's a good place to visit"
Europe,"Monkeys are friendly, just follow the instructions on what you should and shouldn't do when visiting Monkey forest and you will be fine. The instruction board is at the entrance. Monkeys are free in the forest so it's their playground. Staff is very nice and always there to help.
If you are in Ubud, definetly worth the visit!!"
Europe,Who ever comes to Ubud must see this place! The monkeys are all over the place and they are so cute! Just donâ€™t try to pet them!
Europe,"Although it was raining, the trails around and through the forest made us enjoy the visit and the tour. It was not very crowded and the entire tour was very well organized. Even raincoats were quickly available at the local tourist shop. Walking shoes are a must, and no hanging objects on begs and coats."
Europe,"I recommend go there from Ubud by walking. It is really nice walk with many beautiful small temples, shops, Caffes and Restaurant. When you came into the area, there is place with tickets and bar with cold drinks. After crossing this area be careful with your wallets, glasses and everything you wear. Monkeys are playful, but you need to carry your things. We spend 2,5 hour in the Monkey forest. Beautiful nature and historical buildings (or maybe only looks like) are surrounded by a lot of monkeys. Keep you distance, they are still wild animals. It is not a petting zoo. You always want to see feeding. It is in special feeding areas provided by staff. It is like small show :) For Instagramers... A lot of beautiful places for photos but don't go there in rush hours."
Europe,"When you're in ubud you have to go see the monkeys! But beware, they can jump on you, which happened to us. No worries though, just do as thay say - stay calm and dont touch them. If they dont go away there's always staff around to keep them in check. But maybe leave your backpack at home. The whole place is really beautiful and clean. A must see."
Europe,"Once on Bali a monkey visit is a must and the MFS is a great place for letâ€™s say up to 1 hour, donâ€™t bring too much things as the apes will definitely take itðŸ˜‚"
Europe,Quite expensive for what it is around $6 per person but the monkeys are cool. Lovely little forest for a walk around and to kill some time. There staff and people dressed in green are like the carers for the monkeys and are really helpful. One even held our phone for us and fed the monkey at the same time to make it look like a monkey selfie.
Europe,You can not miss this experience if u you are in ubud. In the monkey Forest you can enjoy a nice walk surrounded by monkeys.
Europe,"This place is definitely made to be visited by tourists. Yes, it surely provides the necessary habitat for the monkeys inside, but it's also quite far from the real forests these nice animals live in. Still worth a visit."
Europe,"It's a big forest that includes a temple, a small river and some statues and nice place. It's full of monkeys, but they are not agressive as in some other places of the island. These ones are not hungry so they are nice to the people. Still, you have to be careful as they can try to steal what you have in your hands."
Europe,"This was one massive surprise. Monkeys are free, park is clean and natural, fantastic experience, authentic design elements. Stick to the rules and you will have a great time with the monkeys"
Europe,"Very well run attraction where the monkeys live in a natural environment. Cool, green and not too crowded."
Europe,"This forest is pleasant place to take a walk, though from my viewpoint it is not exceptionally attractive, hence the 3-stars. There are some Hindu temples within and the vegetation is quite luxuriant. Of course there are about 800 macaques wandering about eating food, but despite being well fed they can be quite aggressive."
Europe,"Once youâ€™ve been, youâ€™ve been. But itâ€™s nice to go the once for sure. Plenty of monkeys everywhere but also plenty of them around the walls of the sanctuary as well.

Some nice scenery aside from the monkeys as well."
Europe,"We were taken here by a very knowledgeable guide Beno, it's a well laid out attraction where you do need to do quiet a bit of walking and climbing up and down stairs. On our day it was still quiet warm , but Benonly was happy to tell us about the temples and the Seven different troops of monkeys. The monkeys wandered around us and were quiet at ease with all the cameras, even the mother with her baby.Superb couple of hours spent there."
Europe,"Very cute. It gets hot as hell by 11 and the place is very busy by 10ish so itâ€™s nice to get there early, enjoy the gorgeous grounds and see the monkeys before there are heavy crowds. There is a Banyan tree that no camera can capture the size and beauty of!"
Europe,"What a beautiful, peaceful place to walk along and see the monkeys! Just remember to follow the rules ðŸ˜‰"
Europe,"I love monkeys in general so my rating might be biased. But as always with monkeys you see them do a lot of fun things. The forest is pretty big and there are a lot of monkeys so donâ€™t worry you will se plenty. The unfortunate thing was that the park (rather than forest) has become almost like a zoo, you donâ€™t see the monkeys being â€œwildâ€, they are more about walking around on the paths and around the food containers (feeding spots)."
Europe,"We went as a family with a child 1year old) nice park and things to look at, had been reading reviews of attacking monkeys so I was little scared of them jumping our daughter. However we didn't stumble upon any aggressive behaviour on us. We did see a young lady being attacked though when putting down her purse and taking out something from it.. perhaps a phone? They climbed her and wanted her purse real bad! Be aware that monkeys are smart and real quick, if they attack give them what they want :D and please follow the ""rules"" of the park and don't think it won't happen to you.. it will most definitely happen to you if you are stupid enough to think ""it's just a monkey"".

Also we saw a woman get nicked of her wallet outside the park when she tried to buy something, monkey grabbed and ran!!!

Take care keep distance"
Europe,"We went to the monkey forest and it did not disappoint in terms of seeing monkeys in their natural habitat doing what monkeys do. My one year old loved seeing them chase each other through the trees and occasionally dart across the path. We also enjoyed seeing them stealing things from tourists who had not read the warnings quite as thoroughly as we had, especially when watching a female monkey smash a very expensive bottle of perfume.

The best parts of the park are down a several flights of stairs, which is impossible with a buggy, and barely possible with a child, it is hot and humid and deeply unpleasant for a small person. If we didnâ€™t have a child I would have stayed for much longer as it was truly amazing to watch them doing their thing, but summer in Bali is a lot for a baby."
Europe,"If you are in Ubud you should definitely visit this place. Yes itâ€™s very touristy but also very cool to see all the monkeys playing around, specially the children. But donâ€™t have any loose items on you or in your backpack. The monkeys takes every chance the get to steal things from you. They opened our backpack while sitting next to them and grabbed all loose items they could and than ate them. Luckily it was just pens and napkins this time. It was much bigger than I expected, it took about 1,5 hour to see everything."
Europe,"I normally stay away from zoos and I was glad to learn that this was on their (the monkeys) terms. It's their house and you're just visiting. The surroundings are beautiful and it's more to the place than just monkeys. You can easily spend a few hours walking around this place. Don't try to touch, smile at or feed them though. Beware that the monkeys will also try to steal your stuff to later trade back for an, for them acceptable amount of food. One of them climbed up on me from nowhere and tried to open up my backpack. If that happens just walk away really fast and they'll jump off or contact the staff for help who's always nearby."
Europe,"It was fun to see, the monkeys were really cute but for gods sake keep track of your belongings because the monkeys will steal them if they get the chance. One monkey actually climbed my fiance and bit him when he wasnt allowed to steal his Wallet."
Europe,"It was cheap enough to enter so not really an issue, but it was a bit overrated.
We got to see a monkey with a stolen hat on its head which was fun... and you get to see lots of monkeys and some personality from the monkeys, like very human-like yawns."
Europe,Well worth a visit to get close to and observe loads of monkeys. Beautiful setting and walking distance from city centre.
Europe,"Very well kept, clean, respectful and enjoyable opportunity to get up close to macaque monkeys.

Just remember they are not domesticated and you need to respect their space. Too many tourists trying to get selfies too close and getting themselves into bad situations.

Show respect and you will love the experience."
Europe,"It's a great area to stroll and take some nice pictures, but be aware that the monkeys are clever and mischievous. They are always on the lookout for food, so definitely don't bring food items with you. Also make sure you don't wear anything that can be easily taken from you, including hats and glasses, and be extra careful if you're using your phone to take pictures.

That said, we really enjoyed our time here and didn't mind when the monkeys climbed on our shoulders. But I can understand that some people would not enjoy that, especially since the monkeys tend to travel in packs. It can be a little intimidating."
Europe,"Fun forest with ""wild"" monkeys running around. Never been a big fan of monkeys but everything put together (temples, forest, monkeys) made for a neat experience for the whole family. While I did see a few loose items get taken, it was nowhere near as bad as some reviews led me to believe and they seem to concentrate on plastic bottles and packets of Kleenex. My cell phone and the glasses on top of my head went ignored. We went in July and there were lots of babies with their mother's, none of which acted agressive. Plenty of funny monkey antics which kept the kids amused. The forest and temples add to the atmosphere and it all ties together nicely. Temples weren't open to viisitors when we were there (not sure they ever are). Either way, we would certainly return and I would happily recommend the monkey forest to family, friends, and other TA members."
Europe,"The monkeys will approach and climb all over u, if u sit still. They are curious and sometimes a bit hands on. But fun overall!!! Keep valuables in car for safety."
Europe,"This place will not blow you away, but I am glad I did it since we were in Ubud anyways.

Its basically an open zoo with trees and, you guessed it, MONKEYS. They are everywhere so youll def get some good pics

DO not come from far away just for this, but if youe in Ubud, then its worth 1 hour to walk around in it."
Europe,"The forest in this place is really wonderful. As you obviously expect the forest is full of monkeys that go around freely. At the entrance and all over the places there are advices on how you should not behave with the monkeys (do not bother them, do not look them in the eyes, do not feed them, do not bring with you food, do not bring objects that could attract their curiosity and so on...). Most of the monkeys run around without caring much about tourists, some are kind of curious and kind of friendly (they are nonetheless wild animals...) and some can get crazy for no apparent reason, at least by a human perspective...

During the whole visit I paid a lot of attention to the monkey-rules, and I was looking at the monkeys in a relaxed but totally passive way (not searching for contact and in some cases avoiding it). Despite this, I got bitten by an angry monkey on my leg: a pretty deep bite with blood coming out.
It happened while I was going down some stairs, and a group of 3 monkeys was standing in front of me(3 meters in front). I passed one of them that was giving me the back and one of the monkeys in front did not like it much (the other monkeys were totally chill...). This monkey started to scream at me and instinctively I watched in its direction, probably making eye contact for 1 second. It started to run against me, thus I turned and I walked back the stairs, trying to stay calm, but the monkey grabbed my leg and bite me. At that point I run away. The monkey did not follow me.

I obtained immediate first aid from the personnel of the forest (disinfection of the wound and bendage). The personnel told that I should not have been worried about rabies because the monkeys in Bali do not have it (but dogs can have it in Bali... and what if a monkey gets bitten by a dog with rabies?) and the monkeys of the Forest are checked routinely, maybe they are also vaccinated against it. I did not have an anti-rabies vaccine at the time. Since rabies is kind of lethal I decided not to follow the words of the personnel, better safe than sorry (in the case if rabies sorry equals dead...) and I went for an anti-rabies vaccine (it works against the virus also if you have just been bitten, apparently no need for immunoglobulins injection). The doctor also saw the wound and she said it was pretty deep so she also gave me antibiotics to prevent bacterial infection (you know monkeys do not brush their teeth often). Now the wound is slowly healing (5 days after the injury) but my leg is a bit swollen. I will go to a doctor now that I am back home to ask for his opinion.

The taxi driver that brought me to the doctor in Ubud told me that very often there are people that have some problem with the monkeys. I guess less than the 0.5% of visitors get bitten, but if you do not want to run the risk, do not go to the Monkey Forest. This is my humble opinion based in my personal experience.

Conclusion: nice place, but if you really do not want to risk with the monkeys do not go there. I am not say you will get for sure bitten, and and odds are in your favour, but it can happen... The monkeys, as every wild animal, are unpredictable, at least from the perspective of tourists that cope with them maybe twice in their life time."
Europe,"The forest is beautiful and lush with some monkey related sculptures for ambience.
And the inhabitants are great fun to watch. They are not afraid of humans and come really close. Just make sure not to look them in the eye and donâ€™t try to touch them ."
Europe,"Really nice park and a lot of monkeys all over the place. They have a lot of space and is so cool to watch how they play, fight, take a bath or eat.
Unfortunately many visitors are still to stupid to follow the rules of the park and so the monkeys chew sometimes on plastic.
A lot of staff is around to ensure that nothing happens to visitors and monkeys"
Europe,"As they are regularly fed, they are less aggressive than in other places. They still steal everything they can so be prepared and don't leave anything visible. They even grab water bottles from your bag is they are visible.
Great place. Take enough time to walk around and enjoy the playful monkey babies running around"
Europe,"We really enjoyed to walk around in the monkey forest. Its entrance fee is nothing and you can get a nice insight of it. I carried a bottle of water, which was taken away from me by a monkey within minutes. I only laughed, bc the lady at the entrance already warned me. But the sight of a couple monkey sitting on a girl's head who was shocked wasn't a pleasant momentum at all. You have to be very careful with them."
Europe,Superb place. Thouroughly entertaining and the animals seem to be healthy andwell looked after. Would recommend this to families too
Europe,"I really liked the Monkey Forest. It is as expected filled with monkeys. You don't have to be afraid of them. Just respect them as you respect all living beings and they co-exist with you during your visit. That place also has very nice buildings and temples with Balinese architecture, a little river filled with Koi fish and beautiful plateaus for great views at the nature and of course great opportunities to level up your instagram.
The entrance costs for an adult 80K IDR (~ 5.5$) and for a child 60K IDR (~ 4$) (2019). As for parking, they offset for every hour you parked your vehicle. I was charge with 3K IDR for 1,5h."
Europe,It is very nice place (looks like as jungle). It is easy walk way for everybody. But ve carefully for monkey ;)
Europe,"Must-visit in Ubud. There are couple of temples but above all monkeys. Monkey everywhere, small monkeys, big monkeys. Be aware of your food and belongings or you will have monkey on your shoulder. ðŸ˜"
Europe,Good place to take a walk in a forrest with plenty of monkeys. Definitelly worth a visit if you want to meet a less offensive monkeys than in wild nature.
Europe,Itâ€™s well worth a visit especially if youâ€™re staying in Ubud. Itâ€™s a beautifully maintained park and the monkeys seem to be well taken care of. Not to worry about how the monkeys will interact with you as long as you take note of the rules before you enter.
Europe,"We really loved Monkey Forest and we enjoyed our visit so much!Monkeys there were free, relaxed and so cute:-) We also had some small bananas to give them. We simply had a blast!:-)"
Europe,"The jungle setting with monkeys all over-and temples was great to see. But very hot! Lots of walking, donâ€™t keep anything in your pockets or on you- the monkeys will take it! They can be aggressive, too, so donâ€™t make eye contact.
"
Europe,"The parks not too big, but plan on a full afternoon or morning, and beat the beat: go earlier.
Tons of aggressive Monkeys! Guard your belongings!
So many great photo ops! Have room on your memory cards, you dont want to be fiddling around with changing them in the park, monkeys will snatch anything they can."
Europe,"There are lots of places in the world that are overrun by tourists and on Bali, this definitely ranked up there. But like so many places, there is a reason for it. For a bunch of Westerners who have minimal DIRECT exposure to to Asian cultures, it was a fascinating visit, even without all of the monkeys! Throw the simians in and it was a really neat afternoon walking around with all of the other tourists. Need to rush back? Nope. Glad we stopped? Definitely."
Europe,"They really have made a wonderful place here, with hundreds of monkeys everywhere for you to see, including lots of cute baby ones. One of the highlights was watching the little ones bath in a pool, overseen by a parent monkey who broke up some bullying - just like for us humans!
The adolescent monkeys can be a bit too friendly and inquisitive sometimes so if you have expensive sunglasses I would put them away, and make sure your bags are zipped up. On the small chance you actually get bitten then be reassured that all the monkeys are healthy and you won't catch anything from them, and there's a first aid centre where they will put iodine on the bite."
Europe,Great day out and reasonably priced! Monkeys everywhere both adult and babies can be seen. Rangers assist and help to encourage monkeys for photos with food. Warnings of the danger of approaching monkeys or feeding them - but some tourists still carry water bottles and glasses etc to entice them.
Europe,"Absolutely wondferful place to experience nature but definitely watch out for the monkeys. You are told not to wear hats, sunglasses because they will take them & they do I witnessed it. You also need to watch out when taking photos some people were far too close then the monkeys jumped on them pulled their ears, bit them. If you follow the rules it is worth it to see them & the beautiful surroundings"
Europe,A nice stroll in the middle of the city. Definitely plenty of monkeys and an easy and enjoyable walk.
Europe,"Very nice place, very amazing. Just take care of the monkeys (because sometimes they are hungry and ...angry)."
Europe,"No need to make a special trip to the Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary...........the monkeys are all over the town in Ubud. Be careful, they have been trained to steal your sunglasses, phones, and things out of your backpack."
Europe,"Best place ever seen until now!
Amazing landscape, best place to take pictues with landscape and with monkeys!
Wonderfull place full with a lot of monkeys! Really amazing, looks like it is not from this world!"
Europe,"If you visit this place, make sure it is not too crowded. Otherswise, it's a beautifull place to see !"
Europe,"We really enjoyed our walk around the monkey forest. Over a thousand monkeys live in the forest and we saw hundreds: playing, eating, and jumping on tourists. The younger ones do climb onto people, probably looking for food, but they are very gentle and not aggressive. Definitely worth a trip."
Europe,We had a great time walking around and looking at the monkeys and temples. Definitely worth a stop in. We spent about an hour there.
Europe,"Just thinking about this day makes me smile... I really don't know how to start so let me start from the begining... Do not panic is the first rule you will see before going inside, and then, you go inside and see a lot of people crying and panicing like they saw a tons of tigers, not monkeys... Yes, they can be scarry at some moments, but as the rules are telling you, don't panic and just continue going forward withought running and looking them in the eyes, and you will be okey... When you go around you will see a lot of spots to take the famous selfie with the monkeys, of course with help from the employes there, and i recomend to do that because the pictures are hilarious... If you are scared even a little bit before going here do not have a backpack on your back, they really want to see what's in there and take everything they can, also do not buy any bananas because they can smell it and they will be all over you... I forgot my lipstick unlocked and the monkey stole it from my backpack, they even stoled my tickets for the entrance in there... I tried to take it back but unsucessfull... Overall this day was amazing and very fun, i want to go back to Bali just to see them again"
Europe,"Nice place to go and stay for 1-2 hours. Friendly staff and wonderful views on nature, sculptures, the temple and monkeys. The monkeys are so funny ðŸ˜ðŸ˜"
Europe,"There is a nice forest with beautiful temples. Monkeys are not afraid of people, so you can get almost as close to them as you want. Park itself is quite small, so one-two hours will probably be enough."
Europe,I would definitely recommend going here itâ€™s a pretty cool experience the monkeys get really close and they are very funny
Europe,"One of the most interesting park in Bali.we spent there about 2 hours.
Monkeys are very interesting to watch, when they are out of zoo , cages etc
Great dicorations in ""jungle style"", where nature combines with a park.
Don't take bananas to park,due to in could be dangerous for you, that fruit makes them insane (we ve seen a situation when several monkeys attacked a girls backpack full of bananas). Officially that's prohibited to feed or contact with animals, but you could notice a lot of feeding spots with sweet potatoes and grab some for a safety interaction."
Europe,"Great place to visit, nice temples. Follow the safety instructions re. monkeys as they do bite! But apparently, as told by park medical staff all vaccinated against rabies"
Europe,About a 1000 animals monkeying around in front of x thousand tourist - highly commercial but somehow fun place to visit - itâ€™s like monkey Disneyland in a Balinese forest/temple setting a- still fun to go especially if you on the road with kids - and the forest walk is a nice way to hide from the heat - when in Ubud consider it part of the must do attractions - enjoy the monkey show
Europe,"A must-go if you are in Ubud. You are literally entering the monkeys' house. It is not a zoo, the monkeys are free to come and go as they please (even outside the park if they want). There are staff members everywhere to make sure tourists won't do silly things and the monkeys won't attack you."
Europe,"We loved our visit to the Monkey Forest. We were here in March, so not too crowded. You can get close up with the monkeys. The staff is friendly. Definitely recommend"
Europe,"Monkeys are fun, until they open your bag and steal your sunglasses xD

Had to fight off a monkey of my bag.
Still worth the 80k for the experience :)"
Europe,"Nice experience to go if you visit Ubud. However this is a crowded touristic place. Also the monkeys can be found in the streets around the Monkey Sanctuary.
Note: you cannot touch or feed the monkeys, if you are looking for that, this is not the place. The monkeys sometimes act aggressive."
Europe,"If you have a spare hour, or hour and a half, the monkey forest might be nice to visit. It costs 80.000, which seemed much in the beginning but it is a very well maintained forest. 900 monkeys, divided over 6 groups, live in this park. Unfortunately it is semi-wild, since they get fed 3 times a day. However, they can go everywhere they want, there are no fences/cages. We were very surprised that the female monkeys have got tattoos and some of the staff members annoyed the monkeys for fun, which was really awful to see.

To practice some of your photography skills, this is a great place! Don't forget to leave all your food and drinks at the entrance, the monkeys will know if you don't! We've seen a few stubborn visitors, well; they regretted not listening!"
Europe,"Good way to spend 2 hours in Ubud. Monkeys of all ages, baby monkeys the cutest, visible in a natural rainforest habitat!
"
Europe,"The tempels are prohibited to enter, so what lasts is a playground with monkeys. You can see the monkeys outside of the first as well though on the borders. Nice for children though probably. The monkeys aren't shy at all."
Europe,"When you walk into the Forrest youâ€™ll be amazed by the sudden peace you find compared to the scooter packed streets of Bali. Very good looking area with lots (lots) of monkeys. There are many caretakers who keep the place clean, attend to monkeys, and even help tourists with pictures. The temples look beautiful in the Forrest with the nature and water as a finishing touch!"
Europe,Monkey Forest is nice to visit. Itâ€™s an easy walk throug the forest. Monkeys are not in captivity and can go where they want. There is staff to keep an eye on your wellbeing and that of the animals. Ok to go while in Ubud.
Europe,The monkeys are really friendly and won't jump on you! They also won't try to steal stuff from you as long as you don't provoke them! There are a lot of monkeys so you will always see enough of them. It's 80K to get in and you can walk around freely. Are you in Ubud and have some spare time left? Certainly pay a visit to the Monkey Sanctuary.
Europe,"The monkeys have an endless food suply in the park, that's why they dont have to leave this place.
I thought it would be more of a ""spot monkeys in the wild"" place but it turned out to be a small place where the monkeys are taken care of by a lot of rangers.
Not necessarily a bad thing just not my kind of place."
Europe,"It was my wife who liked to go to the monkey forest as it is famous. However there are more monkey forests is Bali and Ubud as well. There are many monkeys and they are everywhere. If there is food like peanuts they are quick with you for the food and jump on your back and grab you. It is possible that 2 or 3 are on you at the same time.They are not afraid for people. If you stay calm and not panic and make yourself small by kneeling they go off. But be careful with glasses and camera's as the moneys of course do not know the value of those things. I have been in another monkey forest as well and for me that is enough for the rest of my live. It was a good experience though. I would call it good, not very good and not average. But good is not an option, hence average."
Europe,"What a wonderful experience it was visiting this almost magical place. Even though it is a tourist attraction, it still feels as if youâ€™re in the middle of the woods.
Little naughty monkeys are everywhere and will do anything to take a look in your bag to see if there is any food for them."
Europe,Just a fun place to go when in Ubud. The park is very tidy and nice located. The monkeys make it fun for young and old.
Europe,"A must when you are in Ubud. Lot of people but the forest is big enough to easily walk around without feeling like you are in traffic. The monkeys come close by, can even climb on you but else long as you stay calm nothing happens."
Europe,"Visited this placed by myself two weeks ago. It is not very crowded with monkeys and if you don't provoke them, they will just ignore you. The monkeys are fun to see but the park itself is really nice. You feel like walking in the jungle sometimes."
Europe,Many years it was a nice place to go to. But within 25 years there are too many tourists now. Go there and judge youself.
Europe,It is nice to see these monkey's. Nut be awere that they like anything. So glasses or hats will be stolen by them. They also can be quite agressive.
Europe,"they look so cute but be carefull, they almost bite my boyfriend.
just don't feed them, just leave them alone.
Be carefull with your camera!"
Europe,"Nice forest but way too crowded. Entry fee of IDR 80k is overpriced.
My son was bitten by a monkey (he did
NOT challenge them with anything, just stood still) and had to see the clinic for anti rabies vaccine.
The park doesnâ€™t warn tourists enough of this risk as it is a real money maker for the town (and the doctors too).
Do not recommend going in there. Overrated and better to see monkeys behind bars."
Europe,"We loved this sanctuary, it is very clean and well kept and there is plenty to see around.

The sanctuary is home to some 900 monkeys, so you will definitely have a good chance to see them closely and watch them interact, play, relax, with plenty of opportunities for pictures.

In general, the monkeys keep their distance but they will get close to you if they are curious. They will definitely jump on you if you have something that looks like food or other interesting objects (sunglasses, purse, camera, etc.), and they will likely try to steal it so be careful.

Allow for 1 to 3 hours at the park."
Europe,"The Monkey forest, is not that interesting. The monkeys are as well outside as inside to be seen. And sometimes the monkeys are even a bit aggresive. Not my favorite thing."
Europe,"We were a bit hesitant of going there with a two year old, but the monkeys mind their own business and donâ€™t pay attention to you. As long as you donâ€™t bring plastic bags nor food... The security men take care of the monkeys and feed them. We enjoyed being around so many monkeys that walked around freely."
Europe,"We went here in the morning hours. Not too many visitors, so we had enough time and opportunity to see these little bandits."
Europe,"The place changed a bit compared to when I visited 4 years ago. Visitors are no longer allowed to feed the monkeys, which is good but the monkeys are a lot less restless. Make sure to carry your bag in front of you and donâ€™t put any food in it, you should be fine. A monkey did jump on my bag as I was holding it but it did not contain anything edible, so I was easily able to shake him off.

Stroll around the forest and enjoy seeing the animals in their natural habitat.

Bottom line : follow the rules and donâ€™t challenge the monkeys!"
Europe,"You are never bored of the monkeys, they do not interact with humans if you dont engage. They have rehabilitation programs and a lot of staff to take care of the monkeys. Definitely worth a visit if youâ€™re around."
Europe,"There building a new entrance that is really beautiful!

We went in to the park and right in front us a pair of sunglasses where stolen by a monkey.

But the park is beautiful amazing nature. The monkeys are really funny and cute. After a while we sat on a little bench and a monkey joint. The monkey was trying to open my bag so i turned away to see what was going on and the monkey bit me in my arm.

There wasnâ€™t any blood but there is a bruise. Haha so be careful with the monkeys but I definitely recommend it"
Europe,Monkey forrest is a beautiful place where you can wander for hours. The paths are pretty well kept. Please don't bring drinking bottles because the monkey' s WILL get them from you.
Europe,Another location with a lot of monkey's to see. It's different then the other ones we have visited in Bali.
Europe,"I went together with my wife to the sanctuary. This got a good rating on Tripadvisor, so i was really curious. Our hotel is in Kuta, which was about 1,5 hours driving from our hotel. This was quite long, but at the end it was worth it.

The entrance not really expensive. When entering the park you are shown the rules. Do not feed the monkeys, do not touch them and do not smile at them ( they see that as an act of agression) Also you need to make sure you do not have loose items on you, such as sunglasses, hats etc. Just ot be sure.

The monkeys are not agressive at all, but also not scared of people. You can approach them really closely. There are a few feeding stations where the monkeys are gathering if they are hungry. You can see them eating corn and sweet potatoes.

Plenty of staff was around to keep an eye out for the safety of the monkeys and the visitors. Also i was able to get some corn from a staffmember to feed a monkey sitting on my shoulder. It costed me 20.000 Rupia which is a little over 1 Euro. This gave me a great oppertunity to get even closer to the monkeys for a nice photo.

The monkeys can move around freely and do whatever they want. If they wish to stay away from the people, they have all possibilities to do so. If they would like to be close to people, they also can.

We spend about 1,5 hours in the park. Having a nice relaxing walk and look at all the funny monkeys doing their monkeybusiness.

I would really suggest to visit this park, even if it is a bit further driving."
Europe,Great trip! Lovely walk and plenty of interaction with the monkeys. Do remove all jewelry as they will make a grab!
Europe,"This place is amazing and definitely somewhere you have to make time for whilst in Ubud.

Itâ€™s extremely cheap to get in and worth everything you pay for entrance.

The monkeys live so freely in their thousands and which is so nice to see.

Try not to have anything out that the monkeys will take as we did see one take a bottle of water from a ladies bag, they then ran off and opened the bottle to drink it.

Great experience to be had here."
Europe,"Amazing experience to see the monkeys up and close! Keep bags locked up they do know how to open zips. Also watch out for scammers who look like employees, they ask to take your photo then try charge you after!!!
"
Europe,"So this is a must see place - the monkeys have invaded a working temple and run riot there.

Do not stare these monkeys in the eyes and all valuables should be hidden as they will steal them and run into the jungle!

1-2 hours most for this attraction"
Europe,"We loved our trip here! The monkeys are fine, they just walk around you going by there every day lives. It was good to watch them at eating times and the views among the forest are very picturesque. As long as you follow the guidelines provided youâ€™ve no reason to be scared."
Europe,"A really wonderful place to spend a few hours. Even without all the monkeys, it's nice to be able to walk through the shaded forest and see some of the temples.
As per all the other reviews, the monkeys are mischievous and we saw them jump on people and grab stuff out of bags. They aren't aggressive to people (a little to each other) but you do have to keep your wits about you.
Lots of gorgeous new baby monkeys to be seen also... just please dont be like the idiot we saw trying to pick up a baby monkey!
A must do visit while in Ubud"
Europe,"Beautiful place to go if you want to see the monkeys, not sure how â€˜wildâ€™ they are. The monkeys can be slightly aggressive but people need to remember we are in their surroundings. Animals seem to be kept one, was one that managed to get his hands on a bottle of sun cream, which they were drinking. I did report and they seemed to care. Staff are friendly and good with the monkeys, just worry about how they train them to get off when they say."
Europe,"Our guide was not keen on stopping here but we decided to do it anyway and it was a really enjoyable break. Even if you are not keen on the monkeys, the walk in the rain forest is glorious with all the Banyan trees. I thoroughly enjoyed watching the monkeys, in particular when they were preening each other - they look so human. Its a lovely spot for a stroll and a lovely diversion for a short walk."
Europe,Just out from the centre of Ubud the Monkey Forest is a fun visit. The monkeys are everywhere and are so adorable!
Europe,"Good fun and a fine temple in the centre of the site with a spring, be careful not to put items in pockets or appear to be holding anything"
Europe,"We arrived here early and it was fantastic!!! So lovely to see the monkeys in their natural habitat. They are so cheeky and well looked after and fed.

I was a little worried from some stories I heard, but with no need!! A must visit!!!"
Europe,"Great place to spend a couple of hours, plenty to keep you entertained with these little fellows performing there tricks.
Don't let some reviews put you off, just be aware of them around you and do not provoke them, as some stupid lads did to the peral ha !"
Europe,"Lots of monkeys as to be expected, worth the trip down and isnâ€™t to expensive, wouldnâ€™t need much more than an hour!"
Europe,"I was terrified after reading certain reviews and hearing stories about this forest and almost didnâ€™t go, but Iâ€™m so glad I did! The forest itself is beautiful, and whilst I found it scary walking past the monkeys, I soon understood that if you are not holding anything for them to grab, and do not antagonise them, they will leave you alone. There is an art gallery inside, as well as a temple and a first aid area! Strongly recommend going, just donâ€™t carry food!!"
Europe,"The monkey forest is really entertaining. You get to see the monkeys being monkeys, climbing, playing, falling out with each other, and the occasional climbing on an unaware human. Just remember to leave them be and not make eye contact"
Europe,"The monkeys are great in their natural habitat. They have lots of food, can be seen playing and looking after babies. People are regularly bitten, sometimes unprovoked. To try and prevent this do not take anything with you, especially food"
Europe,Me and my partner took a multi trip tour and the monkey forest was first up. It was our favourite part of the day. We had a tour guide with us who talked all about the origins of the monkeys and why they are worshipped. Very interesting and lots of fun as the monkeys are very mischievous and are everywhere. 100% worth a visit while in Ubud
Europe,"Iâ€™ve visited the monkey forest each time I have been in Ubud. I donâ€™t just love the seeing the monkeys but love the beautiful forest too. I was surprised and disappointed in a way to see a big new entrance and the supposedly upgrading of the place. It now feels a little less like a natural forest and more going towards a zoo. Loud speakers now announcing caution etc... in a natural forest, really whatâ€™s wrong with the signs! In my opinion they have spoilt the natural setting somewhat.

What do I mean in the title about people watching?
You are in with wild animals and people seem to put themselves at risk just to get a photo with a monkey, Instagram I guess! We saw at least two people nearly get bitten and Iâ€™m not surprised. One girl trying to get close up and personal with a monkey that had a baby, crazy!

Just observe the monkeys follow the rules no eye contact etc and you will be fine. They are very cute and very funny but wild, be sensible, keep safe!"
Europe,Best day of our stay in Ubud! Canâ€™t recommend it enough. Can you ask one of the cheeky creatures for my pen back?!
Europe,"Loved our 2 hours in this beautiful forest
Great to see monkeys in their natural habitat. Saw loads of monkeys including small baby monkeys"
Europe,"Lots of monkeys loose outside the entrance.
Some were ok, but many were aggressive in the morning.
We did not make eye contact and had no bag or food, yet 3 monkeys were trying to get us.
We then saw one swing down and bite the arm of a boy(about 8 yrs old) he was just walking along with adults. Not doing anything.
This scared me, as he was crying in pain.
For me, they are wild animals, so I'm not sure I want to be near them.

Local cafes etc should shoo them away, as they climb over the fence and try and steal food etc."
Europe,"It's 80k entrance fee for adults, and you can happily stroll about the forest and temples for 1-2 hrs. There are some advisory warnings at the entrance - if you follow them, I think it's quite safe.

There are numerous feeding stations around the forest, but monkeys are everywhere and come very close for ample photo opportunities. I did see a lady leave her bag on the floor to take pictures, a group of cheeky monkeys saw their chance for some mischief and snatched it! They got quite aggressive when she challenged them.

The monkeys were fascinating; plenty of mothers tending to their babies, siblings playing together, group swimming in a pool and having great fun. It's was a thoroughly enjoyable trip."
Europe,Hang onto your bag and watch out for the odd cheeky monkey. Have a a snap taken with one of the keepers or just enjoy taking pictures of the never ending supply of monkeys as you walk around the forest. Great fun.
Europe,"Good value trip here with easy walkable paths around the forest. Plenty of monkeys and no incidents of taking things from visitors. Very impressive guides who clearly love their job and are happy to provide information about them.
The temples are also an added bonus to the walk."
Europe,I went to the Monkley Forest Sanctuary in Ubud with my wife and 2 children aged 14 and 12. we had some anxiety about monekys jumping on us these were unfounded. The monkeys are fun to watch but are well-fed and eviudently maintained as a tourist attraction. At 4-5pm the place was very busy with tourists but the temples and museums were impressive. Overall we were glad we went along
Europe,Had the best day in the Forrest getting pictures with the monkeys. We get some great photos and some good laughs
Europe,"A bit of a tourist trap of course, but quite a peaceful way to spend a couple of hours if you can dodge the crowds. The monkeys are very docile and as long as you just follow the very simple rules there's nothing to be nervous about. If you're lucky you'll see some baby's and be prepared because damn they're cute."
Europe,"Currently 80,000 IDR entry into the sanctuary. There are monkeys everywhere so if you are worried that you won't see any do not worry. We only spent about 45 minutes here, it isn't too big but with children etc you could spend a lot more time.

Worth a visit."
Europe,"Monkeys, in a forest and free to roam. How else can you describe it. The only good thing was the â€™selfiesâ€™ taken by the monkey helpers. Pleasant walk through the forest which hasnâ€™t changed for 30 years. I think it was IDR 150,000 each. A chap in front of me had his water bottle taken and the monkey then spilled it everywhere. I then picked it up and fed it water as it drank from the open bottle. He then bit me! Later after we left and were waiting for the hotel shuttle to collect us, we bought some drinks and bits to take back to the hotel. A very cheeky Monkey left the â€˜areaâ€™ and came to the street and grabbed a load of stuff off my wife who screamed blue murder and the. Having grabbed a bag of crisps he then legged it up a huge tree."
Europe,Loved our visit here to monkey forest. All tickets go to feeding and up keep of the monkeys. The monkeys roam free and there alot of them. Worth a visit and not expensive either.
Europe,"Some say it takes an hour, but you could easily spend half a day without losing interest. Really enjoyed this place - the monkeys are everywhere, free to roam and must be considered the luckiest primates on earth.

You can get really close, see how they interact and watch them feed.

Take care of possessions and don't be an idiot and try to feed or stroke them - many people did and it was rewarding to see their sunglasses stolen into the trees"
Europe,"With the visit for the great food greenery and towering fig trees with nestled temples, and a few monkeys. Good for an hour or two before the hordes arrive from Kuta - go early."
Europe,Great fun. Smaller than I expected but very reasonable entrance price. Only took an hour or so to walk around but was entertaining and staff were helpful and very kind to the animals.
Europe,"We rented a scooter and travelled from Kuta to the monkey sanctuary, the drive was hard work and I would definitely recommend a tour or taxi to get you here however it did not disappoint. Entry cost us just over Â£10 which is very reasonable and the place is amazing, hundreds of monkeys living in their natural habitat , you can get up close to them and get some great photos. Would recommend this place to anyway who is visiting Bali, great reasonable day out for all ages."
Europe,This is a tourist forest with a lot of monkeys in. This isnâ€™t even a big forest. We travelled 1.5hrs to see this. We probably wouldnâ€™t have bothered if I had known how small it actually was. It was a fun hour but it didnâ€™t blow me away.
Europe,"Worth a visit if you have time while in Ubud, but prioritise other sites first.
As long as you are sensible and follow the advice given the monkeys are fine and safe, just try not to stand under one in a tree - they happy to go to the loo on unsuspecting tourists."
Europe,"Three temples within the Monkey forest! Beautiful place! Added bonus are the monkeys living there. We left our bags in our car but typically one nationality has to take bags in with them then complained that the monkeys were going into their bags. One hysterical woman had her phone charger stolen ( obviously needed in the forest)) and chased the monkey. Luckily the rangers got it back before monkey but into it and made itself ill. Another guy was teasing a monkey with food ( pretending to give it and then pulled it away) until I told him he was being cruel. Big signs saying not to feed but there has to be a first aid room for visitors who obviously know better, saw one guy who had been bitten! If you can't respect wild animals ....don't go there!
We loved it!"
Europe,We absolutely loved spending the afternoon at monkey forest. It was such an experience to see the monkeys up and close. The tickets are reasonable and def worth every penny.
Europe,Monkeys are wild animals which some people underestimate. Many tourists go there with things the Monkey may take of them so be considerate.
Europe,"Well worth a visit if your in UBUD area , approximately 1100 free ranging monkeys ðŸ’, very cheeky , constantly checking everyone out for food & bits to pinch !
Cost 80 k ( Â£4 ish) for adult & 60 k ( Â£ 3 ish ) for children , takes around 1 to 2 hours to walk around the pathway through the forest & temples .
Monkeys are kept in check with around a dozen rangers , around the park . But you can get up close , especially at the feeding stations ."
Europe,"If youâ€™re in Ubud, or anywhere in Bali really, the first question people tend to ask you is if youâ€™ve been to the Monkey Forest. Its one of Ubudâ€™s best known attractions and is a must for anyone in the area.

For around $8 you get entry for the whole day, so you can come and go as you please. Iâ€™d suggest going earlier and avoiding the busiest times which are around midday.

What to expect: Monkeys... Everywhere! Thereâ€™s a bit of walking to see all the area, and you will find monkeys everywhere. There are park rangers who feed the monkeys and make sure everything is running smoothly. The monkeys are very curious so donâ€™t be alarmed if they come over to you and even jump on your back.

I managed to get a couple pictures of the baby monkeys which are adorable.

I highly recommend anyone to go as its a must if you are in the Ubud area."
Europe,This a great half day visit to the Forrest. Well worth a trip and walking distance from the centre of Ubud.
Europe,"Nice forest full of monkeys, don't be scared, they don't bite you if you just walk around and dont disturb them.
Don't wear glasses, hat or anything they can take, they will take it!!!"
Europe,Beautiful forest right in the center of Ubud. As its name indicates itâ€™s absolutely full of monkeys. Beware of them! You leave your bag somewhere for a second and they take it!
Europe,"We loved coming here. We were a bit wary of the monkeys as they do fight amongst themselves and they jump all over you and go through your pockets, they have mastered unzipping bags.
Worth a trip.
"
Europe,Itâ€™s great to see so many monkeys playing and in their natural environment. They are pretty cheeky though! They are ninjas with zips on back packs. There are many staff around to keep them safe and ensure the people are careful and respectful.
Europe,"It was a lot less crowded compared to when my friends went in the morning the day before. They now have several first aid stations that are open. And they no longer encourage visitors to feed the monkeys.

I noticed at least three cases of monkeys jumping on people. No one hurt: basically just donâ€™t be stupid and follow the simple rules posted at the entrance and all over the park."
Europe,"Itâ€™s ok,you see a few monkeys being fed,chasing eat other and grooming picking bugs from backs.
There was one or two screams from the visitors but otherwise itâ€™s very busy. It does have a useful shuttle back to Ubud centre."
Europe,"The trip started with one of the Monkeys pulling a button off my daughters skirt which was hilarious, given that we had been very careful to hide lose items - sunglasses, cameras, water bottles etc but didnâ€™t expect that! The forest is beautiful and the monkeys very cheeky but good to watch. Very easy to get tickets at the entrance and wander around at leisure. Enjoyed."
Europe,Iâ€™ve been to a monkey sanctuary elsewhere and the monkeys were much calmer and disinterested in people. Here the monkeys will quickly take things on display and were more confrontational. The site is really lovely and itâ€™s a good experience but I do worry about the behaviour and perhaps how habitualised the monkeys are to people. So this could be 5* or less than the 4* I am giving depending how you feel. At least theyâ€™re free to escape and wander the local hotels!
Europe,"It is actually very cool, maybe a touch touristy but nice.
The park is a very nice park on its own where to have a walk + there are monkeys everywhere kept free and well fed"
Europe,"This is a fantastic activity to do in Ubud, there are similar things in the UK, but the monkeys interact more here with the passing visitors.
They are very friendly and are extremely well looked after by the attendants around the park.

I would advise being careful with sunglasses, bottles of water and handbags as the monkeys are very inquisitive and would love free drink or the contents of your handbag!!"
Europe,"We visited the monkey forest with real apprehension after reading a variety of reports about people being bitten. So I had to write a review just to put anyone who felt like I did mind at rest. If you follow the rules clearly given you will really be fine! If you are really worried go in the afternoon when the monkeys have had so much food they wonâ€™t bug you anyway.

So we witnessed a couple of monkeys becoming slightly aggressive and for the simple justified fact the people they were growling at were forcing themselves right next to them and taking selfies, then pulling their phones out of the monkeys hands when they grabbed it- I mean what do they expect when they shove it in their face? So go the monkey forest enjoy it, follow the rules and enjoy the monkeys from a distance."
Europe,"We loved the monkey forest! Monkeys are not at all afraid of people but not aggressive - they mostly ignore you. I used to study monkeys and was a bit worried theyâ€™d be mistreated but staff treated them well and most visitors have them a bit of space. The forest is beautiful, and there are huge spectacular trees within the main area."
Europe,Would visit here again in a heartbeat! Loved it! Got a little wet and had a monkey sit on me at one point as though I was t even there but was a great experience!!
Europe,"I was a bit afraid to go aÅ¥ first after reading all the stories about people being bitten and the rabies situation, but I am really glad I went.
I fully agree with everyone writing that if you following the guidelines of the sanctuary and leave the monkeys alone, there's nothing to be afraid of.
Don't bring food, water bottles and don't touch the monkeys and you will be just fine.
There are also local guards all around the forest to assisst anyone who might need help. But if you follow simple rules and have respect to the animals, you will have great experince.
It's a beautiful forest and is nice and fun watch the monkeys in their natural habitat.
Reccommend to everyone"
Europe,"So much fun well worth a fiver to enter a must for me adhere to the signs though reference feeding and personal belongings as the monkeys are you guessed it cheeky and will take stuff.
Fabulous surroundings aswell."
Europe,"Lovely attraction to visit. Monkey everywhere, I particularly enjoyed mother monkey and baby monkey sharing love.
And also has a lovely walking path along the forest.

Do not take any water bottle or plastic shopping bag monkey think it's a food and try to take away from you(witnessed some attack from monkey)."
Europe,"The monkey forest is cheap to enter (80,000) and although itâ€™s usually rammed with people, there are plenty of monkeys around to see, and park rangers offer to take photos with them. The actual forest is very pretty and well maintained. Considering this is such a touristy attraction we were pleasantly surprised at how respectful everyone was of the animals."
Europe,This is great way to spend an afternoon or morning. Very enjoyable and reasonably priced. Give it a try!
Europe,"The Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary in Ubud is unlike other monkey places around because this is actually a sanctuary built in the natural habitat of Balinese long tailed Monkey where they are cared for (aka fed) but tourists can not touch or pose for pictures with them. That said, they are hungry little creatures and at even the slightest inkling of food, they will be all over you (see photos below of them trying to climb up my dress)!

While a few people recommend the entire morning at the Sanctuary I found 45 minutes was enough especially as we arrived early, about 8:30am to catch the feeding time and were able to explore the grounds with only a handful of other people around. After feeding make sure you wander down into the rain forest!"
Europe,We had alot of fun walking around the monkey Forrest. Was great to see the monkeys running free in their natural habitat. Some where cheeky and naughty but made it more fun
Europe,"This really is 'must do', absolute 'must do'. when with teens and they absolutely loved it, just an amazing experience .. the staff are excellent and the monkeys seem happy, free and looked after. lovely evnvironment and some great photos ... so glad i went."
Europe,"Lovely to see so many monkeys roaming around free to come and go as they please.

Beware you donâ€™t hold objects to close to them. They are so quick to grab things.

Spray plenty of mosquito repellent as the area is humid. Perfect conditions for the pests.

"
Europe,"We are very conscious about animals being treated well! And looked after well. Hence there are some animal related places we did not visit in Bali due to their reputation.

This however was a breathe of fresh air!

What a simply amazing place. The monkeys are clearly very happy! Have heaps of free space to roam and there is nothing keeping them there other than it being their home and letâ€™s face it. They are fed! Haha.

We got some great pics of the little guys and it was an amazing experience! Itâ€™s only 80k for an adult to get in. Thatâ€™s around Â£4.50

Well worth it!"
Europe,The Sanctuary is very commercialised but the monkeys never cease to entertain. Adding fruit bats to the watch list was interesting to some in our party and cringing to others!
Europe,Worth a visit - be very mindful of having food in your bags as they grab anything thatâ€™s loose. There are signs up saying what u should not go. The monkeys are interesting to watch and we arrived at mating time - there was a lot of babies running around xx a must when u visit ubud.
Europe,"Worth a visit and is only 80.000 idr per adult. If like me you are a little apprehensive about the monkeyâ€™s getting too close, donâ€™t worry. They do not seem bothered by the visitors and quite happily go about their day as if you are not there. The grounds of the sanctuary are lovely and offer lots of places for photographs."
Europe,"It is what it is really, if you want the opportunity to see a lot of monkey's in a manageable space - go here.
It isn't very cultural or mind blowing but it's pretty and clean. I personally think it's expensive for what it is and would not visit again but if you have some time to spare in Ubud - give it a go!"
Europe,"An easy walk from the main centre, this is a good place for a couple of hours in the morning or afternoon! Although shaded, it was a bit hot. The monkeys were great and some very very active! I had at one point two on me, kindly rooting through my bag for goodies. They handled my ear phones but kindly put them back and rezipped my bag before finding another tourist. Generally if you follow the instruction they won't be violent at all! I just walked for a bit and they lost interest, but we did see another guy who tried to hit one on his friend with a gopro! This definitely had a back effect and the monkey was not best pleased and bared his teeth!
The actual sanctuary is beautiful - amazing jungle with wooden ledges to cross the river and descend and ascend. Would definitely recommend. I believe it was 60 thousand idr per person."
Europe,You will be sure to see many monkeys when there! The temples are very interesting although as tourists we are unable to enter some (prayer only). Be careful when there because the monkeys are not afraid of humans and will jump or run at you if you are antagonising them. Read the signs and you will have no problem!
Europe,"Walked down Monkey Rd to pay my 80,000 rupiahs to enter this mystical forest. Yes they feed the monkeys so tourists can see them. However there is an animal clinic on site and feeding them keeps them off the surrounding roads. Did have the strange experience of watching a monkey turn on a tap to get a drink of water. The landscape itself magical, with a deep ravine, jaw dropping bridges and incredible, huge trees. Well worth a visit, get there early before the tours from the coast arrive, if you can."
Europe,"A worthwhile visit in Ubud- the sanctuary was large enough to make a solid 2 hour visit and the macaques were not hard to find! A word of warning; they will jump on you and root through any bags (and turn aggressive if you resist) so try to make sure you're not carrying food, even in a zipped pocket."
Europe,"Yes, it's a forest, and yes, it's full of monkeys, but there's more to it than that.

There are three temples within the sanctuary, featuring some ornately carved buildings, beautiful courtyards, and numerous statues (some quite erotic!).

There's the forest it's self, almost a jungle, with it's lush foliage, and small river with elaborate bridges.

There are birds, fish, bats, butterflies, etc. plus an exhibition room, an open stage/amphitheatre, and a forest conservation area.

So, yes, go to see the moneys, but don't miss all the other stuff, too."
Europe,"We were sceptical of visiting after reading all the scary reviews but found the experience really fun! We were very practical and cautious - removed all our jewellery and hid our bags but the monkeys didnâ€™t seem bothered with anyone. People had phones, cameras and bags and were totally fine. Maybe we hit a lucky day. Our 10 year old daughter loved it and we all felt safe! Lots of fun walking along the jungle paths exploring. Beware which exit you take as we ended up leaving through gate 3 on the wrong side of the park and having to back track!
"
Europe,"If you want to get up close to these mischievous creatures in lovely surroundings, then this is the place.

You gently stroll around the well kept paths, exhibits and statues and will come across plenty of Monkeys and if you like get really close to them.

Although familiar with humans, these are fairly wild and unpredictable animals so be careful....there are plenty of signs telling you what not to do !

We really enjoyed our visit and you really feel like youâ€™re in their environment."
Europe,Great thing to do! Worth a quick visit. Very busy so go early. Fun seeing the monkeys but beware they try to get in your bags
Europe,"One of those types of attractions you should visit even if you don't particularly want to. I have seen many a different monkeys on my various travels around the world so not such a once in a lifetime thing for me.
However I did enjoy walking through this sanctuary and watching everyone interact the monkeys.

I went in with no bag or anything apart from a camera and I would advise you do the same. I saw a monkey try to drag a bag off a girl and luckily a guard came around just in time and it ran off. They are inquisitive animals so be prepared."
Europe,"We visited 2 years ago and they sold bananas that you could feed to the monkeys on the way round the forest. But this time they didnâ€™t have the banana stall. We asked a guard and they said it was because people kept being bitten.

There were guards all around the forest this time keeping an eye on everyone.

A large part of the forest was closed as there was a big ceremony on"
Europe,"We included seeing the Monkey Forest as part of a day tour to Ubud. You follow a well placed pathway following signs. Easy for most able people. The monkeys are in a good environment and seem happy to eat and play with plenty of trees.
We especially like seeing the baby monkeys."
Europe,"Easy to get to and inexpensive. Plenty of monkeys but too many people. Worth an hour or too, go early morning if you can to avoid crowds"
Europe,"At first we were a little apprehensive about going after reading all the negative reviews involving the monkeys. However we found that they are quite tame and are very used to humans interacting amongst them.
We did witness quite a few tourists provoking them for a reaction to get the perfect Instagram pic or video which might have otherwise ended badly but there were no dramas and all quite pleasant in the end. The actual grounds are spectacular. There are 3 temples, each with different landscapes for you explore and it seemed each one ventured you deeper into dense jungle.
Worth a visit and Iâ€™m glad we went."
Europe,"A fun place to spend a couple of hours watching the antics of monkeys. Do beware... they WILL try and get in tour bag, steal items, or get food. Just go wearing/carrying very little and you will be fine."
Europe,"Only a couple of minutes walk from centre of Ubud. Costs RP 80,000 for adults.
You get to walk around the forest thatâ€™s teaming with Monkeys of all ages that are often inches from you. Loads of great photo opportunities."
Europe,"I stayed in Ubud and the walk to the forest was about 5 mins, i would HIGHLY recommend this place. I think tickets were about Â£5 each i really cant remember but i know i thought how cheap.
There so many monkys running around just be free. The stuff look like they look after them well!

You cannot feed the monkeys but this did not stop getting great pictures.
I went when this opened and i felt it was perfect because it was not busy at all!!"
Europe,"I was pleasantly surprised after hearing done horror stories about vicioys, obese monkeys which turned out to be untrue. The monkeys only approached people with food, water bottles or rucksacks. Even without the monkeys this would have been a pleasant walk through some stunning scenery."
Europe,Me and my partner love monkeys but there were a lot of people around and felt there were too many people here for the monkeys. Some of them were unruly and we saw one chase someone and take a water bottle off someone else. We did feel that we had to be careful around them- not the monkeys fault of course theyâ€™re wild animals but the set up could be better for them such as Sangeh which is much better and cheaper.
Europe,We loved our time in the monkey forest. I especially appreciated that it is more focused on conservation than tourism. The guides are everyone and make you feel very comfortable. This is a very unique experience.
Europe,"Monkeys monkeys everywhere, but not a drop to drink. I'm a monkey, you're a monkey, monkeys, monkeys monkeys."
Europe,"I absolutely loved it here. There are lots of cheeky monkeys who will try and grab things from you if they get the chance. But mostly they are just wondering around, and playing.
Itâ€™s great to walk around all of the sanctuary and temples and just see the monkeys roaming.
There is also a cafe a the entrance to grab refreshments. Highly recommend this place for a visit"
Europe,"The monkeys are very interesting.

The reception area is big and has a cafe, western loos, lockers etc.

Do not open your bag even to get no food out as the monkeys thinks itâ€™s food and grabs the bag."
Europe,"I was a bit nervous before visiting as Iâ€™d read the monkeys can attack. I stayed a distance from them and they seemed fairly happy and ignored us. We saw them being fed, they got a bit noisy at that point. It was nice to see the animals free to roam. The baby monkeys were very cute."
Europe,"Walking distance in Ubud, go see the monkeyâ€™s they are worth a visit. Watch your jewelleryâ€™s, we seen an earring snatched."
Europe,"we spent four very calm hours absorbing the wonderful atmosphere of this amazing sanctuary. Take your time, explore everything, read the notices and DO NOT carry any food whatsoever, the monkeys can sniff it out from a mile away and will attack to get hold of it."
Europe,So this was a great place but kinda scary as there are monkeys literally everywhere. But mostly they keep them selves to themselves but seen a monkey try to steal a ladies hand bag and also another jumped on my shoulder scary but fun at the same time specially as we donâ€™t get that at home in UK. Definitely recommend it.
Europe,"This amazing experience has to be the highlight of our trip to Bali. We felt safe as well as free to explore amongst the monkeys. We had the opportunity to feed them as well. Enjoyed it very much, will be back again."
Europe,"Itâ€™s inexpensive and staff are very friendly! Really lovely walk, didnâ€™t take that long to walk around and monkeys were well behaved."
Europe,"Having come across the Sacred Monkey Forest on trip advisor and Instagram we were really excited to go.

It didnâ€™t disappoint and also had lots of beautiful temples that we werenâ€™t aware of.

Aside from one monkey, the monkeys were not aggressive however were a little curious. The staff are on every path keeping an eye out and appeared to have a respectable bond with the monkeys with some hanging of the staff trying to get food."
Europe,Was amazing but there are other places you can see monkey and actually feed them think the only reason you canâ€™t take food itâ€™s coz the monkeys fight over the food the monkeys arenâ€™t as dangerous as the are made out to be
Europe,"Itâ€™s a good place if youâ€™re interested in seeing lots of monkeys. Just make sure to be careful, as they can be quite aggressive and steal your stuff. I watched many a person have their things nearly taken by monkeys. Theyâ€™re cute from a distance but can bite."
Europe,Really pleasant and interesting place to go. Lots of one type of monkey. They are really well looked after and seem happy with lots of young ones only a short visit but a must do.
Europe,"My partner and I really enjoyed this. Be aware of the keeper monkey calls, he will round the monkeys up in seconds. Also watch hair clips, if they shine the monkeys will attempt to snatch them, hence the 4stars, I had to fight off a monkey for a clip and they are very aggressive when they want something. Enjoyable all the same!!"
Europe,"Always hide your belongings!!! They will try to steal your rucksacks. So much fun, really good experience"
Europe,"Bring no bags, bring no food, if you do you're asking for trouble. If a monkey climbs on you just stay calm and walk away. Amazing jungle forest and lots of monkies"
Europe,Exactly what it says on the tin. A large forest area filled with monkeys free roaming and interacting with visitors. The keepers are great too helping to take photos and generally making sure both monkeys and guests are safe. Definitely worth a visit!
Europe,Good place to take the kids to. We went as part of a tour group and walked in amongst the monkeys. Fun to watch but do be careful of any belongings as the monkeys will take things off you as seen below.
Europe,"Itâ€™s lush,huge and picturesque too.
Monkeys are so well looked after and very well fed too! They roam around freely!
Some are very cute and cheeky and some huge and look scary but are actually harmless!
You got to keep your things safe as some are bold enough to jump on you if they see something on you they want!
Beautiful setting, ancient statues and temples in the grounds plus a tropical rainforest area.
You could spend all day there !
"
Europe,"You cannot stay in Ubud without going to monkey forest, itâ€™s an enchanting area and a perfect place to watch the world go by.

The museum has local art work and some amazing photos of what ubud was like in the 1970â€™s, a stark contrast to what it is now.

If you havenâ€™t visited the monkey forest then you havenâ€™t seen the real Bali"
Europe,"A great place to spend some time. The monkeys are fantastic, if you are lucky you will see them playing in the pools."
Europe,Great setting in the heart of Ubud. Monkeys run free and are everywhere. Fun to watch and pretty happy to pose for a photo it is a great opportunity to see these little dudes up close. Very very good value for money and worth the visit.
Europe,"The monkey forest is an absolute must-see if you plan on going to Ubud! Such a fun day out and itâ€™s lovely to see the monkeys roaming free in their natural habitat. Donâ€™t let other comments about the monkeys being unpredictable put you off. Honestly, the monkeys are very used to being around people and donâ€™t actually tend to approach you unless you are sat down or they want to grab something you might have in your hand. So to be safe, donâ€™t wear your sunglasses or have them on your head and take great care when having your phone or camera in your hand! Also ensure your bags are zipped up securely as the monkeys are cheeky and very smart!"
Europe,"A really beautiful space and absolutely packed with monkeys, they are pretty placid but I did see them come very close to some people. I was able to use my phone/sunglasses with some care."
Europe,"ABSOLUTELY amazing!

What an experience! Please visit when you get a chance

they didnâ€™t come near us so please donâ€™t be scared too much by the signs ðŸ˜‚"
Europe,We came at 4.30 pm which was when the monkeys were being fed in their temple. This meant it was easy to see all the monkeys in one place. There were loads of cute babies. In general monkeys were friendly (compared to the other monkey forest in Bali) however it can be quite overwhelming having so many monkeys around.
Europe,"Always a fun day out. Quieter in the morning, free parking with entry, lots of baby monkeys and lots of fun"
Europe,"This place is so good! The monkeys seem really happy and the workers go round and feed them corn on the cob! It's so cute!

The monkeys do like to climb you and look through your bag so make sure its locked shut ðŸ˜‚"
Europe,"Lovely place to walk around, lots to see as well as the monkeys! Theyâ€™re all roaming free which is lovely, and you can get some great pics!"
Europe,"This was a fun activity if visiting Ubud. Time needed I would suggest is around 1.5 - 2 hours.

The monkeys are fun. Do not be tempted to feed or touch them. If they climb on you stay calm and don't panic or they can become aggressive.

There are a few do's and don'ts when you arrive. Don't wear sunglasses or bring a bag which can't be zipped up.

Great experience and a must do if visiting Bali.

Tickers are priced at 80,000 RP (Â£4 GBP) per adult at the gate."
Europe,"We left within half an hour. We followed all guidance as to not bringing plastic bags or food into the park & let our distance from the monkies, however both me & my partner had them jump on us while the security was nowhere to be seen. When 2 ran towards me & started tearing at my dress with their hands & teeth, ripping several holes, we decided to leave."
Europe,"A very unique and special place to visit. It has the history with the temples but the excitement of the monkeys, so cute and lots of baby monkeys too! A must visit if in Bali! Traffic in this area is AWFUL!!! (Just a heads up!)"
Europe,"I loved that place. Nature and animal all you need for one hour in relax. You don't need special shoes but training shoe are recommended.
Usually the monkey are quiet but it's depends on you so don't bring food and please respect the animal and their environment."
Europe,"We visited on a rainy day, but had a great time with the monkeys... the place looks amazing, with the walk in the middle of the jungle and the temple. Monkeys are funny and always trying to steal something from you... but very chilled out... you can get close to them and they donâ€™t care, as long as you donâ€™t try to touch them or make eye contact..."
Europe,The forest has been made into a beautiful place where you can visit some temples within the area. The monkeys are fairly well behaved and don't bother you but are drawn to water bottles and WILL try to take them so be careful. The staff took photos for us and would help if any monkeys were bothering you. Very fair price of 80.000rupiah per adult. We spent almost two hours here.
Europe,What a great experience!!! Monkeys really well looked after and so friendly!! Made my day one jumping on to my head.
Europe,Lovely place with plenty of monkeys that are still wild but used to people so they arenâ€™t scared and easily visible. They are happy to walk around and be very close to you but do take notice if the signs and donâ€™t look them directly in the eye as this is seen as a challenge.overall a nice way to spend and hour or two
Europe,"The Sacred Monkey Forest is like nothing else Iâ€™ve ever seen. The monkeys roam freely and tourists walk amongst them in their habitat. There are numerous food deposits that seem plentiful with fresh food and so the monkeys stay within the forest, although some do venture out into the surrounding streets. There must be thousands of monkeys and many with young babies. We didnâ€™t sit with the monkeys so they didnâ€™t bother us at all with regard to stealing our phones/sunglasses etc. But they are cheeky and bold and used to humans being amongst them, so watch out! The Forest itself is beautiful with walkways, a stream and a temple. This is a â€œmust seeâ€ if you are staying near Ubud."
Europe,"We came here as part of our honeymoon trip and we were so glad we did! Itâ€™s a great morning or afternoon out! I absolutely love monkeys and my new husband and I stayed here for 4 hours just watching them play, eat and relax in their own habitat. You are told not to bring food or valuables into the forest, please respect that. We saw a few items taken from people by the monkeys, they will not hesitate to take something they want, but they are not at all aggressive. Because of this, they seemed relaxed and calm around us and I felt safe enough to be walking in their company. Our favourite part was watching them down by the amphitheatre where there is a small river. They seemed so happy and playful with one another it was a pleasure to sit and watch them! Would totally recommend a visit if you are in the area!!"
Europe,"Definitely worth a visit for an hour or two while in Ubud and only costs a few pounds. The forest is really big with some nice walking paths around the temples too. Youâ€™ll see loads of wild monkeys and on the whole they leave you alone unless you bring food or paper bags! Staff members assist in getting monkey â€˜selfiesâ€™ or ...getting them to go away!

"
Europe,"Itâ€™s a must do trip when you visit Bali , Ubud , lovely grounds and surroundings monkeys everywhere get some cracking pictures a great day out"
Europe,Loved visiting the Monkey Forest! The best thing to do in Ubud. Top tip: maybe donâ€™t wear coconut smelling sunscreen as you may get mistaken for food!
Europe,"I thought Iâ€™d be sending off these monkeys from seeing YouTube videos. As you are forbidden from feeding them, they are not at all interested with being close to you. It was like watching them in a zoo. You may not touch them, look at them or grin at them. After a rainy day, most of the monkeys were in the trees. I struggled to take any interesting photos of them and would have liked for one to jump on my back! Nothing doing.

That said, it was well organised with plenty of staff and it could have been a sunnier day, so maybe it could be better here under these circumstances. Also, none of us got bitten by a monkey, so I understand why theyâ€™ve got so rulesy."
Europe,"You must visit the monkey forest when in Bali. What a great place, charming forest, temple and the monkeys are so cute. Well recommended."
Europe,"We visited the monkey forest two years ago and loved it, it was a bit chaotic with monkeys stealing food from people who had bought bananas to feed them and girls screaming with fear but a pleasant visit non the less to see these lovely animals roaming free, this year we visited again and it was completely different we didnt see anyone feeding the monkeys but certain areas were designated where the workers would feed the monkeys, this was much better and the place seemed more organized and cleaner. We saw lots of monkeys and some still cheeky enough to try open backpacks that people were carrying but other than that I think this time round it was a much better experience, my husband again this year got pounced on by a monkey and I had the pleasure of one come and cuddle me as I was sat down. If your in Ubud it's a must do experience and well worth the 80,000 rupiah (Â£4/5)"
Europe,"I am big endorser of animal sanctuaries and hate seeing them behind bars and cages. If news reports are to be believed then itâ€™s true that animals are not safe in the wild anymore, some level of human
intervention is required but the question still remains, how much is too much?

Let me come back to the point about my visit to the Monkey Forest in the regency of Gianyar in Bali. There is nominal entrance fee to the sanctuary and you can also opt for a guided tour if you so wish. At the entrance desk donâ€™t forget to pick-up a copy of the brochure available in several languages, which has brief information about the sanctuary along with a map.

The walk begin through a man-made cave and has couple of routes that can be opted for. The entire sanctuary has a mystical feel to it. There are 3 temples inside the sanctuary, one of Lord shiva, the water temple for goddess Gangga and the Cremation Temple. These temples date back to 14th century and are accessible only for Balinese who want to offer prayers.

There are plenty of staff members inside the sanctuary who help and guide visitors about how to interact with the monkeys or even take a picture with them. Itâ€™s forbidden to feed the monkeys and is best not to carry any food items in backpacks. The monkeys are quite mischievous but not at all harmful. There is a first aid centre in case of any animal attacks.

There is also a Banyan tree thatâ€™s more than 100years old. It towers near the dragon bridge. A very nice location for pictures. There is also a boardwalk that lets you get up close and personal with the fauna around the forest.

Thanks so all the towering trees, it was quite comfortable to visit even during noon time.

Overall, a nice place to walk around and observe the Balinese long tail monkeys in their natural habitat.
"
Europe,"The monkey forest is awesome. So many monkey families everywhere, you are guaranteed to get up close to them. Also it doesnâ€™t take you long to walk around this monkey paradise so thereâ€™s no time to get bored and you could probably walk round the whole sanctuary in about 45 mins at a comfortable pace. Itâ€™s right next to the street in Ubud and is a must see. There are plenty of maps so you know where you are and so many cute monkeys jumping around. Be careful not to touch them but donâ€™t panic if they jump on your head! Keep your bag closed (although they are super clever and know how to open zips and drawstrings if they think you have food in there) definitely a great place for children to see monkeys
"
Europe,"Set in stunning forests, the Monkey Sanctuary is a haven for the resident monkeys. Roaming free, they really own the place, forcing visitors to walk around them and avoid them! There are stunning temples and walks around the forest. Watch out though, this is the monkeys home, and they remind any visitors who get too close! Eye contact is a no no and they will jump on you and help themselves to your sunglasses, food and drink items, and any loose clothing. If threatened, they will attack so show them respect! Fabulous day out for all ages."
Europe,In the heart of Ubad is a sanctuary well worth a visit. My daughter and I had travelled to Bali from the Uk and spent a week touring this wonderful island. Our last full day we did a day tour round some places of Ubud and the monkey forest was a fabulous part of the day. The monkeys are fed but the keepers at feeding posts throughout the park so you are guaranteed to see them. The place is clean and tranquil. A beautiful place to visit
Europe,"Does what it says on the tin, entry is reasonable and there's lots of staff there to make sure the chimps don't get out of hand.

Go take pics and look at cute baby monkeys, try not to wear sunglasses or make eye contact!"
Europe,"Loved the visit here it was 80000 IDR per adult, very cheap not even Â£5 each.

Monkeys were so close it was great to see and even walking around the forest was just amazing. Would highly recommend."
Europe,"The main attraction here are of course the macaques - roaming around, stealing stuff, eating, playing and just being monkeys.
Not being a big fan of monkeys, I still loved the forest for all the other stuff; the giant trees, the Holy Source, the three temples, the hundreds of statues (traditional and modern), the nice walk in the lush greenery, the stream, the flowers, the ponds with the giant koi fish.
The temples are still active places of worship and when we visited there was a major ceremony happening so we had the opportunity to see locals bringing food and offers and praying and socialising ans showing off their best attires."
Europe,"It was baking hot, packed with tourists and hard to relax. Lots of monkeys and the baby ones were very cute."
Europe,"Absolutely loved it!!!

Lock up your backpacks, keep nothing in your pockets as these are very cheeky monkeys ðŸ™‰

Wonderful day experience the natural environment. We would advise to go after 14:00 as they wouldâ€™ve been fed.

Reasonably priced."
Europe,"The monkey forest has improved enormously since my last visit 20 years ago. The space is well managed and the walk through the forest and temples is well signposted, and manned by friendly staff. Nice to get up and close to the macaques, which are hugely less aggressive than they used to be."
Europe,"The monkey were being fed on arrival, and they were perfectly behaved. The forest is wonderful, temples, waterfalls. its just fascinating to watch the monkeys who take no notice of you at all."
Europe,"This was such a wonderful visit. You wander at your leisure through stunning natural forest along well maintained paths. The monkeys are free in the forest and stroll casually around you on the paths. There a feeding stations at intervals and many wardens at hand to ensure safety. The monkeys can touch you or climb on you so you are advised not react nervously or carry food on you in bags or pockets as the monkeys are wild and will look for food.
It is not an alarming experience at all and we really loved it.
Really recommend it."
Europe,Within 5 mins of being here I was attacked by a monkey and bitten - spent the entire day in hospital getting jabs and medicines. Really would not recommend
Europe,We had a driver on a day tour with a stop at the monkey fires he was so knowledgeable and the place itself is just gorgeous the monkeys are an added bonus. Great day out
Europe,"Visited the monkey forest yesterday, lovely place! Alot bigger than we expected to walk around :) Plenty of monkeys about with a few areas where they are being fed by the people who work there where they tend to gather :) I believe they dont sell food for you to buy to feed the monkeys anymore, however we found a guy who worked there who asked if we want help to have a monkey on our shoulder for a photo, he fed the monkey for us to get it onto our shoulders for a picture, asked for about Â£2.50 for both of us which we were happy to pay for the awesome photos we got! Later on I sat down next to some monkeys and one came and decided to destroy a small hair toggle I had that looked like a flower though Haha! If you have a monkey on you and want it to get off just stand up and start walking they are no trouble. Beware of nibbly flies and ants around your legs in this area too, we felt like we were being munched somewhat!!"
Europe,"Monkeys are so cute it was the first time I was able to see monkeys in nature! Can't stop starring at them with their babies !! But be very careful with your things, they can even open your bag!"
Europe,"TBH we weren't expecting much prior to our visit. However we were pleasantly surprised to find a clean and relatively spacious forest. We walked around the entire forest in approx. 2 hours. Obviously there is monkeys everywhere, however we found them all to be on their best behaviour lol!. They appeared healthy and well looked after. There is some very good photo opportunities to be found whilst walking around."
Europe,"Great must see place in Ubud, however make sure to be careful when taking photos as they like to steal camera batteries and shoes!! Cheeky monkeys!"
Europe,"Loved, loved, loved the Monkey Forest. Situated just outside of Ubud with modern, clean reception area to great you. Easy to spend half a day following the various pathways though rainforest and to a number of small temples. The monkeys themselves are fabulous. Important to take note of the warnings especially re loose items but overall they are not threatening in the slightest. Highlight has to be watching them swim and the babies. NB you can get a taxi back into town from the street by the main entrance. Cost 50-80k rupiah"
Europe,"Great fun to see so many monkeys in their natural habitat
Donâ€™t take any bags if you can help it - and definitely no food - they are very clever & quick
We saw monkeys take cigarettes / credit cards / camera battery from other visitors"
Europe,"On the first day of our first holiday in Bali SJ & I had to visit Monkey Forest which we had been looking forward to for a long time. At Â£4 entry each we had a great 3 or so hours wandering around the Sanctuary at our own pace and in awe of the number of monkeys and their antics. The place was busy but we found corners of the park that we very peaceful apart from the noise of birds and of course the inhabitants who are there to look after the temple. The public were very respectful of the rules, clearly displayed and the only real trouble was caused by the monkeys chasing each other and the older ones rightly commanding their position in the hierarchy. Whilst the monkeys canâ€™t be stroked or given food a few of the younger ones did venture on to us!
Bali is value for money and this attraction was no exception. A great half day wandering aimlessly around taking 100s of photos and just enjoying the antics on these sacred animals."
Europe,"We didnâ€™t know what to expect and itâ€™s actually a fun, charming place to visit. Monkeys everywhere. Lovely temple and great statues everywhere. Itâ€™s perfect for a little walk. 2 hours max.

Watch out if you have a bottle of plastic. Monkeys will just try to grab it no matter what."
Europe,"Had a great day out in Ubud. Made the mistake of trying to shoo a monkey off my partner. Don't do this!
Highly recommend going to the Traditional Opera of the Monkey King story in Town at night. Probably wrong but think it's called the Kakak Ramayama or something. (sorry Indonesians).
A really magical place striving to stay."
Europe,100% recommended. Despite being busy itâ€™s incredible for both the monkeys and the nature! Amazing trees and rainforest where the little animals live!
Europe,"Large forest hosting loads of monkeys and very cheeky .... They are not aggressive if you respect the rules, ie don't look them in the eye, don't parade your iphone, water bottle or bananas in front of them! They are free to roam around and will make the most of it. Fun place to go to if you love apes. Awsome selfies to do!"
Europe,We spent over an hour here but could have stayed longer but we didnt take food as advised. We did see lots of people stopping to get the attention of the monkeys but its not advisable as they could turn on you any minute. This is there habitat and that should be respected. It was a great day out watching them play.
Europe,This places doesn't take long to go around but if you are in the area it's well worth a visit. The monkeys are pretty cheeky and will try and take you hat and shades if you get too close. Good fun!
Europe,One reason to stay in Ubud was to visit the sanctuary. What a great experience to see them roam wild and play. Itâ€™s a must visit if you go to Bali.
Europe,"This place is beautiful and not just all about the monkeyâ€™s. Spent a couple of hours here walking through nature and being entertained by the monkeyâ€™s. They are not as cheeky as I imagined and keep themselves to themselves when the tourists donâ€™t tease them. Cheap to get in too, about Â£4 pp."
Europe,"An interesting time at the forest. There are plenty of signs saying what you should and should not do. The monkeys ignore you if you follow the rules.

There are cute baby monkeys and a temple that the monkeys inhabit.

Overall ok experience for 50k idr as you are paying for the monkeys to be fed and looked after. I wouldn't spend more than 2 hours there.

If you however are a cheapskate that wants a monkey photo then if you wait just outside the sanctuary you are likely to see them wandering up the street or hanging off overhead cables."
Europe,"A good tourist spot to visit and see lots of monkeys, they leave you alone if you leave them alone! There is an entry fee (approx 60idr) but the area is huge and even if you donâ€™t want to see monkeys itâ€™s a beautiful area to walk around. Easy to walk here from Ubud town rather than doing it as part of a tour etc"
Europe,Interesting place to visit if you are into wildlife and monkeys. The monkeys were roaming around the area and were generally friendly. Nice temples inside as well. Worth a visit as it would be a different experience.
Europe,"This is our first time in Bali and the monkey forest was the signature attraction of our holiday. Must visit, even if you are scared of monkeys. Also in the forest is a beatuful jungle landscape walking area."
Europe,I was a little worried about visiting the monkey forest after reading some horror stories about attackâ€™s online. We found the monkeys were generally quite well behaved though. We did see them stealing things from people but if you donâ€™t give them opportunity by carrying lose objects youâ€™ll be okay. The monkeys were amusing to watch and the forest is a beautiful place to explore. It costs next to nothing to enter and you can not visit Bali without seeing the sacred monkey forest. If you respect the monkeys they will respect you and you will enjoy your time here. The monkeys are rarely to blame when people get hurt.
Europe,The tourists blatantly ignore all the signs saying don't touch the monkeys. Feel a little sorry for the animals as they appear a bit bored and pace up and down.
Europe,"So lots of monkeys roaming free. Awesome few things to do before going there.
Donâ€™t take any bags/food with you they are smart and they will jump on you to get to those things.
Other than that enjoy your walk in the forest nicely maintained and lots of monkeys to see.
I would recommend.
Would I go again ? Probably not
"
Europe,"We visited the sanctuary as part of a longer tour and wish we had taken more time here. Yes, some of the monkeys are a bit noisy and threatening, however the overall experience was a very enjoyable one, with the jungle and the monkeys making this a must do visit if in the Ubud area. We would recommend you allow at least 2 hours."
Europe,Good couple of hours spent hear . The monkeys are well behaved if you stick to the rules . They are wild animals after all don't tease or feed them and you will be fine
Europe,"If you want to see the monkeys you could just park up outside as there are plenty frolicking about, jumping on car roofs etc, youâ€™re paying to be amongst them & whilst the walks are scenic if steep in places they can be slippery underfoot.

There are 7 troops living in the forest consisting of approx 857, we had no trouble with them & there were lots of tiny infants which drew the crowds, however at Rp 80,000 it was one of the most expensive attractions & whilst still cheap for what it is Rp 50,000 would be more realistic. I would just advise friends to park up outside & watch their antics."
Europe,Really enjoyed our visit here! You easily stay a couple of hours and have a nice walk round. The monkeys were entertaining. Good value for money.
Europe,"Girlfriend got attacked for a bottle of water. If you go, take absolutely nothing with you. They jump on anyone with a bag and will bite if you try to remove them.
Nice scenery but that's about it."
Europe,"Lots of monkeys, but lots of people! However, the monkeys were terrific, all you want. Very relaxed and used to we sightseers. Lovely venue too, great trees, ferns etc."
Europe,Wonderfully laid out and easily walked. Wear mosquito repellant as under trees and by water. If you have a bag make sure it closes securely and nothing is hanging from it as the monkeys WILL steal it if they can although there are many staff members around keeping an eye on the wildlife AND their visitors. We did see one poor monkey drinking from a bottle though......but it was hand sanitiser! What did it do to that poor animal's stomach! Well worth a visit.
Europe,There were many many more humans than monkeys in this forest. Itâ€™s so obviously a tourist trap but saying thatâ€™s the topography is beautiful. So serene and well designed. Plus my children had fun so all in all worth it.
Europe,"We had a great time here. The sanctuary is very well-laid out this means the monkeys are all around you as you walk through beautiful forest and gorge settings. Do follow the safety guidance as we saw monkeys try to steal and make to attack when under threat. Despite this, if you are sensible, and love monkeys, you'll love this place - see the pics as evidence :)"
Europe,"The phrase cheeky monkey comes to mind.
Although the monkeys are fed and have people around to help make sure nothing goes wrong. The monkeys will push it. When we went the monkeys were pretty docile. Lazing around and sleeping. It is a quite a big establishment and you will see many tourists so expect a bit of walking.
We also so a tourists dress get bitten, bottle and watch almost get pinched by the monkeys so just be careful.

You probably donâ€™t need a tour guide and they give you a map upon entry so its pretty straight forward.
"
Europe,"Such a unique and enjoyable experience but at first slightly scary! As long as you don't annoy them they won't annoy you!

Someone was jumped on and bitten whilst we were there but he deserved it for provoking and chasing a wild animal.. what do you expect!"
Europe,"This place is brilliant! Entrance fee is reasonable at 80.000 each with over 600 monkeys inside. There's a lot to look at, though don't sit down too long as the monkeys are keen to climb the tourists and try to open any bags they have in search of yummy treats. Got some wonderful pictures here and had a really lovely time. The monkeys are free to come and go so you will see some outside on the street. Would definitely go again!!"
Europe,A shortish visit as a very hot day. All enjoyed the monkeys plus we had a close run in with one that wanted (and got) sun cream out of our bag. Ubud can be way too busy so it was nice to chill out here a bit.
Europe,"So pleased I went here. The monkeys are really cheeky and can be unpredictable but stay calm and youâ€™ll be fine.
Go with as little as possible because they are clever little things and can get into anything. Very touristy but itâ€™s a must do if in Ubud!"
Europe,"As always, top tourist points are very crowded some time, so suggested to arrive early to get more space in the forest path and catch the best moments, dont keep walking, stay somewhere where most monkeys are and definitely they walk around you or give you great chance to take a few photos. Never carry any plastic bag or food, keep your belongings in your back bag. They are not going to steal your phone but anything colourful or shiny thing takes their attention. No cafe or kiosk in the forest apart from the entrance cafe. Get your water and drink it monkey free area.. ðŸ˜† Enjoy.."
Europe,"This is a busy place but you still get to see lots of monkeys in a natural setting which is just great. They are free to go wherever they like and as you walk around they are happy to sit playing with a coconut or chasing each other surrounded by tourists.
We stayed a couple of hours and all really enjoyed our time there - would definitely recommend a visit"
Europe,"We were having a lot of fun until a monkey landed on my husbands back and started to open his rucksack and try steal the contents. He tried to shake it off and got bitten hard on his arm. Really hurt!!! We were told that the monkeys do not have disease, and no rabies. But few days later learned that if a local gets bitten they always have a rabies jab. So 4 days later he got a rabies jab, followed by a second one 3 days later.
It may be true, they may not have rabies or other diseases here at the sacred forest but itâ€™s really not worth the risk. If you get bitten go get the jab and get antibiotics too."
Europe,"This is a nice place to visit if staying in Ubud. A short walk from the town, cheap entry and good fun.
Nice walks, good views and loads of monkeys.
We'll worth a visit."
Europe,We loved looking around the monkey forest temples and felt like you were in the jungle. Also loved watching the monkeys. They will try and get in your bags though so be careful!
Europe,"Very slick operation with free parking if you keep your entrance ticket. You canâ€™t feed the monkeys which actually makes them better behaved. However the same canâ€™t be said for visitors who seemed shocked that their bags, glasses, hats and water bottles were stolen! Be prepared ðŸ˜‰

The grounds and temple are really nice all shaded so perfect if youâ€™ve had too much sun"
Europe,"Arguably Baliâ€™s best known and most popular tourist attraction! OK it can get busy, but itâ€™s definitely worth a visit to get close up and personal with the numerous Balinese long tailed monkeys that frequent this beautiful Jungle setting!"
Europe,Lots of monkeys and well fed and look after. Really helpful shuttle bus taking you back to town for free as well.
Europe,"You will get to see loads of Monkeys! They are everywhere and some cool areas along the valley with a river and temple style ruins.

Itâ€™s a complete tourist trap but should go if youâ€™re in the area. Itâ€™s not expansive and lots of staff keeping it organised and tidy.

There is loads of shade so even if hot you wonâ€™t fry in the sun."
Europe,"Go later in day when monkeys aren't hungry. Good to see in ubud.
Monkeys are more well behaved later in the day"
Europe,Iâ€™d been avoiding this place after encounters with scary monkeys elsewhere in Asia. But I fancied a walk & the forest offered plenty of shade away from the hot sun. I was very pleasantly surprised. The forest was lush & green (though itâ€™s just at the end of the rainy season) & the monkeys were well behaved & fascinating to watch. So glad I didnâ€™t give it a miss. I was there early & it was getting packed when I left so Iâ€™d avoid a late start if possible.
Europe,"I feared that because it is such a 'must see' attraction in Ubud, that it may be a bit tatty or tacky. But NO, it is a really enjoyable way to spend a few hours. It does not feel exploitative of the monkeys, who are free to come and go as they choose. The environment is clean and tranquil - it's an oasis in the otherwise busy centre of Ubud. There was a very good display of local art inside the park as well. At IRp 80,000 (Â£4) each it really does live up to it's 'must see' expectations."
Europe,"Some of the reviews I read almost put me off visiting the monkeys, bit I'm glad I ignored them! The monkeys here we're some of the best behaved that I have experienced and apart from a couple of non-aggressive contacts, they were fab to watch. Amazingly, they lived to swim and jump into the pools which was fab to see! Lovely shady walk through the forest and ruins too."
Europe,Lovely place but as I was wary of monkeys we passed through quickly! Lol! Saw a monkey try and go down a ladies top and that just about finished me off! Ha Ha!
Europe,"Loved it!!! We had great fun walking around the beautiful forest watching all the monkeys, even though a really wet one leapt on me (remember to zip up your bags!!!)"
Europe,"A fantastic experience to be amongst monkeys in the wild, They can be cheeky monkeys so be on your guard and follow all the guidelines"
Europe,If you can stand walking around in very hot weather the monkey forest is worth the small price you pay to enter. Not only do you see the monkeys but it is a beautiful park with lots of lovely architecture.
Europe,"Abit moree of the pricey things to do in Bali but worth it. The forest is preserved wonderfully for the monkies who get well looked aftered.
The trees and forest itself are beautiful and you can see how old the trees are.
We spent an hour here walking around. It gets abit hot and we did come out with a few mosquito bites.
There were alot of benches and places to sit around while walking my elderly parents."
Europe,"If you are in Ubud it is definitely worthwhile to visit the monkey forest; it is not too expensive (80k IDR per person) although prices keep increasing.

I would recommend for you to be mindful of your belongings and try not to disturb or annoy the monkeys."
Europe,"Go early when it opens, itâ€™s hot and can get busy! Why wouldnâ€™t you want to see the monkeys itâ€™s so close to ubud centre!"
Europe,"It is 50,000 entry to enter and walk around the grounds which while nice in most places the main draw here is quite obviously the monkeys, of which there an abundance roaming around and you will certainly get up close with them as they are not shy in the slightest.

A few things to note on that point would be that yes, they do jump and climb on people, they will take mobile phones, glasses and hats and they will try to open bags. Bringing food or drinks with you would be a particularly bad idea. The monkeys can get aggressive however on the most part are more interested in each other than us.

Itâ€™s an experience and for most of us a rare one, however would certainly suggest to be cautious with personal belongings and only go if you are comfortable with close animal encounters."
Europe,"lovely walk in the cooler forest, you must go see this. Just remember these are wild animals, and will steal your items. Got some lovely photos of the monkeys with babies. lovely to see in the wild."
Europe,"Youâ€™re told a list of rules before entering, one of which is to not look the monkeys in the eye. Found it hard to look at the monkeys and not catch their eyes, stressed me out trying not to do anything that would provoke them so left after 10mins"
Europe,"The Forrest is large with lots of paths and many, many monkeys roaming free. I was excited for the visit but wary that the monkeys have sharp teeth and carry disease so having researched online I went with no floating clothing, no accessories and no bag. I was VERY cautious and gave the monkeys lots of space, and came away unscathed. Most people however encourage the monkeys to jump on them and therefore the monkeys learn to do this to many unsuspecting tourists (Eg. One man who kept trying to stroke a baby whilst the mother got more and more agitated, another â€˜ladâ€™ coaxed some onto his arm). Whilst there I witnessed one climb up a ladies skirt, 3 jumped from a tree onto my partner and another couple jumped on a poor lady who was very afraid. Itâ€™s advertised as having guards for the monkeys but they didnâ€™t seem bothered and I saw on sat on a swing on his phone! They didnâ€™t seem to notice when the monkeys jumped on people and it took shouting for them to help a lot of the time.

Itâ€™s an interesting place and I would recommend going but exercise caution and bring limited objects for them to grab. The monkeys are very much wild."
Europe,"Loved the monkey sanctuary, you get really close to these animals, who are cute and sometimes overly friendly! definitely worth a visit."
Europe,"Firstly let me say that I'm not a fan of zoo's or similar attractions, I'm also not a fan of wild animals that have access to my face.
I was not hugely looking forward to the Monkey Forest but I was pleasantly surprised. The forest is vast and we only spent around 1hr there, when you are under the tree canopy it get very very humid, prepare to sweat.
The monkeys are kept attracted to the forest as they are feed by the staff, they are not caged or chained as a result you can get up close and personal personal with them, but you are instructed not to.
You can enjoy watching them frolick and play but this doesn't stop a few simpletons from feeling the need to let them climb over them. The entry fee is reasonable given what you are getting for it and it is within a stone's throw of Ubud.
The monkeys weren't as full on as I'd expected them to be but we arrived at around 10 and they were being fed so we don't know what they are like when hungry."
Europe,"Youâ€™ll have a great couple of hours here, more if you want to stay longer, the joy you have walking around the monkeys natural environment is awesome, itâ€™s true they smell out food if you have any on you! Lots of photo opportunities with the monkeys as they wander around, cheeky as they are. keep your green entry tickets on you, together with your parking ticket, as you have to produce ALL at the exit barrier to get the free parking, otherwise itâ€™s 3000 rupiah but still very cheep. Note that the ubud market is very close by too. Have a great time."
Europe,"Something changed for the worse in 6 years between my last visit and this. There are leas monkeys and they are a tad more curious they used to be. Also the place is now commoditiesed, they built a full infrastructure around it. So it feels more like a zoo than what it used to feel like a park where monkeys live truly free. I guess it is still worth going especially if you have kids as it is a hit with the little ones!"
Europe,Nice big park to see absolutely hundreds of Macaque monkeys running and just being monkeys really. I'm not a big monkey man but I enjoyed myself nevertheless!
Europe,"My husband and i were there last week while staying in Ubud. I wasnt sure what to expect as we had been to Thailand the other year and the monkeys there were horrible, very aggressive so i was a bit wary. There were no problems at all. It was quite busy and the only incident i saw was one monkey stealing a bottle of water from someones backpack but it was his own fault there were people and signs saying not to have anything like that on show. Only 80k IDR for admittance and you can take as long as you like to walk around. Very pretty scenery and dozens of monkeys. A good afternoon out"
Europe,Really nice place to see the monkeys and lovely walk through the forest seeing the temple very interesting
Europe,This is a good place to see the monkeys. The moment you step in youâ€™ll see them. Also a nice place to have a walk.
Europe,"With more than 800 monkeys in the sanctuary, this made for a fun day out. Suitable for the whole family and in a beautiful setting. Would thoroughly recommend."
Europe,Roaming free as they should be. Some cheeky monkeys may jump on you but usually they do their own thing. Interacting with the keepers without being caught or handled. Breaking into the food cages was a great video opportunity. The grounds are breath taking. Beautiful unique trees & sounds of the jungle are incredible. Definitely worth a visit
Europe,"Weâ€™re reasonably regular visitors to Indonesia and Bali is often a part of the plan. Thatâ€™s usually when I make a fuss about not spending all our time on the Costa del Kuta and ask for a day in Ubud. Going to Ubud with kids this is an ideal place to spend 2-3 hours (would suggest avoiding the midday heat). Like much of Bali itâ€™s very pretty and you can stick to wider paths or if youâ€™re more agile you can take some less used tracks. Iâ€™d recommend this place for anyone with kids 11 or under. Just watch out for those monkeys, theyâ€™ll get any food you bring if they see it!"
Europe,While in Ubud got the chance to go to the monkey Forrest wasnâ€™t too sure about going after seeing people reviews before regarding being bitten but it was a great experience. The monkeys were well looked after and could come and go as they please - the rangers would keep and eye on the monkeys and any that was climbing all over people they would get them off without any issues .
Europe,"One of the highlights of our trip to Bali, so impressed and much better than we expected. The site and set-up are really impressive with a modern entrance and visitor facilities, and beautifully maintained. Didnâ€™t expect it to be so extensive and scenic. Even without the monkeys, it is a beautiful place to visit, with the ravine running through it, little temples in the forest and the most amazing trees. The monkeys though are the reason for going and they are delightful and obviously well cared for. It was nice to see the keepers joshing with the monkeys like old friends. They are used to visitors and not in the least annoying - so long as you keep to the rules. One visitor pulled out a cereal bar and then wondered why it got swiped by a monkey within a few seconds. The main parts can be quite busy, but not too hard to get away from the crowds and find quiet and shaded spots.

Also struck by the fact that there were no walls or fences around the forest. We came out of a side entrance and the monkeys were quite happily crossing the road and then (I assume) crossing back again to go home. A great experience."
Europe,"I read some of the reviews for here and was nervous to visit however my own experience was drama free! Monkeys were so cute and itâ€™s a great environment to walk round. The monkeys stay away from you as long as you donâ€™t encourage them. I didnâ€™t want to take my bag in case they tried to get in it but they didnâ€™t get anywhere near. DONT TAKE FOOD OR DRINK IN. There are signs everywhere but still people ignored them, the only time we saw monkeys jumping on people was for food or drink bottles."
Europe,We didn't stay long but out visit was enough to appreciate the beauty and peacefulness of this place. Really worth a visit or two
Europe,"Funny experience the monkeys are super tame, will sit right next to you. Reasonable entrance of 50,000 rupiah. We enjoyed the visit. There were a few mosquitoes so spray before arriving. Lovely area to walk through."
Europe,"Loved this place. Read all the reviews. They are spot on. Monkeys everywhere. Nothing to worry about in terms of being attacked provided you follow the instructions....
One shock though. I googled 'how much to get in' and when we arrived were asked for double the prices being quoted a few years back. In fact it looks like it went from 50k to 80k in one year !! ouch ."
Europe,"We visited the Sacred Monkey Forrest in Ubud with people who'd been 2 years ago and expected the Monkeys to be full of mischief. Whether it was just a good day, but we saw plenty of Macaques in their natural habitat but no incidents or thefts of property... There were a good number of Park Staff around to ensure no monkeys or humans misbehaved! A good couple of hours..."
Europe,"Spent a pleasant hour or two wandering around the Ubud Monkey Sanctuary. We arrived around 3.30pm and the keepers had not long put food out for the various groups (there are 7 scattered around the forest/ temple/ cemetery areas).

Fascinating watching the mothers controlling their babies, the younger monkeys playing, chasing and play fighting and all ages engaging in grooming.

Pleasant and relaxing way to spend an hour or so. We were warned beforehand about monkeys taking bags, cameras etc, but we didnâ€™t see or hear of any such problems, maybe because everyone is aware and so careful with possessions."
Europe,"Beautiful forest, temples and macaque monkeys. I went with my mother who was concerned we might be pestered but the monkeys mostly just get on with their own business.
Lots of little ones and chance to observe their monkey dynamics close up and natural."
Europe,I visited Monkey Forest on a lazy day when had nothing to do. It was very nice and monkeys were very funny to watch. Made lots of nice photos and if you are traveling with kids it's a must see attraction. Just make sure you don't carry bag in your hands or eating food
Europe,"Went here as part of a day tour. Loved to be able to get so close to the monkeys, very cute and not afraid of humans, the park is lovely for a walk or just to sit and watch the animals. Appeared to be well looked after and saw them getting fed by a keeper. Had a great time."
Europe,"Great fun, monkeys up close and in the wild - well worth it. Loads of your babies there when we went which was cute overload !"
Europe,"a must to stroll through whilst you're in Ubud. watching the monkeys swim and play with hte fish is hilarious, spend a good couple of hours here"
Europe,"This is such a wonderful experience, the monkeys are free to roam, and are of good health. You will not be disappointed to this visit as they are in their own environment and not in captivity. Don't wear sunglasses or carry food, as they will take any loose items (especially the juvenile monkeys)"
Europe,We went just after opening and it was still cool. There are a lot of trees so shady even in high sun. I enjoyed walking around where the monkeys roam free but be aware you are warned not to feed or touch them. One did jump on my rucksack on my back and very quickly undid the zip I managed to dislodge him before he took anything but you must be very aware of them. The most annoying thing is people taking selfies. Anyway I really enjoyed time spent here.
Europe,"Well worth a visit if you are in town.Cooling tree in a hot day!
Keep your bags and food safe from the cheeky monkeys!"
Europe,"An interest forest location, with temples and statues a plenty. The monkeys are cute and taking a camera is a must to get the best out of this visit"
Europe,"My husband and I visited as we wanted to see some of the popular sites in Bali, staying in Ubud we werenâ€™t far away. The place was popular with lots of people arriving and filtering through but didnâ€™t feel crowded. There were helpful rules signposted on entry and the place was mapped out quite clearly. Inside I was a bit hesitant about being so close to the monkeys but they were clearly used to all of the visitors and didnâ€™t pay a great deal of attention which helped with my apprehension about being so close to them. Some beautiful and fascinating things to look at in addition to the monkeys - old statues etc. We were in there for around 45 minutes (we couldâ€™ve taken it a bit slower but were packing a lot into the day) - cost 50,000 IDR each"
Europe,"Beautiful forest and it was great to see the monkeys wondering around. At times, I was slightly worried as we got deeper into the forest and they seemed a little aggressive. One monkey was eying us up when we were walking past. I happened to wear a long skirt, it grabbed hold of it and climbed on top of my head! I was quite scared, luckily my husband scared it away. It was a great experience and we thoroughly enjoyed it, minus the monkey climbing on me."
Europe,"This is a really good and informative experience. The monkeys are everywhere in a natural environment with strict rules for visitors and conservation. The surroundings are lush, the entrance fee very reasonable and gives free parking on presentation of the ticket. Lots of photo opportunities and easy to spend a couple of hours wandering around, enjoying what is on offer. A really good trip thatâ€™s definitely worth it."
Europe,A great few hours spent wandering round and watching the monkey's antics! They were amazing. The keepers were great at ensuring visitors didn't get too close - don't touch or feed the monkeys! A brilliant experience.
Europe,"Absolutely loved this place! It took us about 2 hours to walk around and we saw hundreds of monekys in their natural habitat playing, eating, fighting, trying to open the zip to our bag :) The staff are wonderful so donâ€™t hesitate to ask questions. The grounds are also gorgeous, especially the Holy Spring Temple and the Forest Conservation. Try and go early for a chance to get involved with feeding them breakfast :)"
Europe,"Expensive for a small place with monkeys.

Is worth the experience though.

Monkeys are savage if they slot you with food!"
Europe,"Lovely area, peaceful to walk around and admire the forest as well as the monkeys. The staff were friendly and helped us get some great pictures with the monkeys."
Europe,"I can certainly say it didn't disappoint, it is indeed monkeys, in a forest environment. Only $5AUD / 50K IDR entry which I feel is fairly reasonable given they could probably charge three times that due to the footfall.

Some of the areas were closed due to refurbishment or repair, did not seem to matter that much.

The animals themselves are plentiful, but do be wary, they will pinch your water bottles and any other items of food / drink they can see. All part of the fun.

Ample parking provided too, unsure of charge as we were on foot. Does seem to have cafe and toilet facilities at entrance."
Europe,"Please donâ€™t make the same mistake I did by ignoring other similar reviews to this one.
Itâ€™ll be long but stay with me...

My partner and I visited the Sanctuary in December 2018 and were having a nice time walking around the grounds. We saw a few people being scratched/attacked by the monkeys but just swiftly moved away.

Later I took a seat on one of the many benches and watched the monkeys (huge mistake!). One of them unfortunately took this the wrong way and went for me... biting my hip!! Other people around me were feeding the monkeys, but I wasnâ€™t so they got aggressive.
Luckily the bite wasnâ€™t deep (looked more like a scratch), but it did draw blood...still nonetheless we wanted to get it checked out.

At the first aid booth on site the â€œparamedicâ€ (no certification so no idea if he actually was) seemed to down-play the severity, saying he sees 5-10 people daily with bites, some even needing stitches. He gave me an alcohol wipe and showed us a form which states the monkeys here are rabies free (please remember this for later on).

We left the sanctuary and decided to do some of our own research, stopping at a pharmacy to ask their advice, who again said it was okay.
After some research we found Ubud Care Clinic and headed there. They were very good and helpful and advised that iâ€™d need 2 booster shots. Unfortunately, and Iâ€™d say shockingly, they and all other clinics/hospitals in Ubud had run out of rabies vaccinations!!! This was apparently due to the festive period.

They recommended we try SOS International Medika in Denpasar, we firstly called to check they had the medication and were told it is in limited supply so we packed our bags (now 11pm) and headed there ASAP.

The staff at SOS Medika were brilliant, very helpful and knowledgeable (considering they see this everyday!) and had great English for us travellers.
After review of my vaccinations form, the doctors here told me that I actually wasnâ€™t covered against rabies and would need a full course (donâ€™t get me started - apparently the clinic I went to in the UK before we left misread my vaccinations form and thought I had received a rabies booster jab, but no...).

Anyway, as there is no proof that the monkeys are rabies free, even though the sanctuary have â€œcertificatesâ€, there is NO way to tell if an animal has rabies UNTIL it dies & you examine its brain. Also, the Ubud forest is completely open, we saw on many occasions the monkeys outside the forest, on the streets where they can interact with dogs.

Due to the rabies risk I also had to receive emergency immunoglobulin (RIG) injections...3 big jabs into my bum and 1 into the wound. This liquid is sooo expensive!!! Itâ€™s measured against your weight and contains rabies antibodies to start the fight (if you have rabies).

The doctors here also told me about Herpes B virus (a monkey disease), which is very rare but can cause brain damage... no thank you.
(Side note - no one else we spoke to: first aider, pharmacist, first doctor in Ubud, mentioned this disease to us.) Anyway, I was given a 2 week course of Valtrex tablets to take 3 times a day, every day.

In all in, this treatment cost around Â£3,500!!!!! This was a huge shock!
I also had to complete my rabies jab schedule so went back for 3 more injections, meaning we had to change our plans etc. But thank god for travel insurance!

Of course you read many reviews of bites/scratches from the monkey forest and many people just ignore the risk. I read several reviews of people bitten/scratched that didnâ€™t get them checked out or receive any medication, but we were taking no risk! Even if you have had your full rabies injections, you still need to have 2 extra jabs after a bite to cover the risk.

This was a huge price to pay and I regret going to the sanctuary. I would highly advise people NOT to visit, especially if you go with children!!!
The monkeys here are aggressive and dangerous, and the RIG injections hurt me, an adult, let alone a child! I am also now afraid of monkeys and wonâ€™t be visiting another sanctuary.

Definitely not worth it!"
Europe,Lovely to see the Macaca monkeys in as much of their natural habitat as possible. I like that this is a conservation project supported by the local community and that time has been given to the research. The public cannot feed the monkeys which is good and there are plenty of signs to make sure visitors respect their natural behaviour. It still must be a bit strange having lots of cameras shoved in your face but nothing to suggest they are stressed and the park shuts around 5ish so they get peace. I enjoyed walking around so much I want to go back before I leave.
Europe,"We had a private tour, this amazing place of worship is unlike any we have seen before. Full of temples, greenery, jungle, and animals, its quite exotic. I suggest buying the bananas to feed the monkeys, its so fun!"
Europe,Absolutely loved this place . Monkeys wandering around everywhere. Staff looking after them. Do not feed them! Great cafe and very clean place
Europe,"The Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary is about one hour thirty minutes from Kuta, mainly due to traffic. Well worth a visit, walking amidst the monkeys from first going down into the sanctuary. A huge area to cover, monkeys galore at every turn. Not allowed to feed or interact with them unless they come to you. Monkeys of all ages, one mum had twins she was carrying around with her. All looked in good health and frequently fed. Watch your belongings- keep them safe."
Europe,"This place is magical and beautiful. Itâ€™s like being on the set of Indiana Jones! (If the extras were monkeys). I was told the monkeys would be aggressive, not to wear shades, donâ€™t take your phone etc etc but none of this is true. Just donâ€™t wear a bag, donâ€™t reach into your bag/pockets and donâ€™t try to pet or make eye contact. Your phone is fine. Just co-exist with some monkeys and enjoy being alongside them. The most that happened is that one used my dress as a hand towel after eating his sweet potato! Theyâ€™re funny and cheeky but not aggressive because they are fed regularly and used to humans being around."
Europe,"One of our highlights in Ubud. The monkey Forrest is lovely and the monkeys are so funny. Iâ€™ve never been so close to a monkey before.

Very cheap and the grounds are nice.
Staff are lovely and very helpful.

Keep hold of your water bottle ðŸ˜‚"
Europe,I loved my time spent at the monkey forest. There are so many monkeys to see and lots of babies around this time of year. Although it was very busy with tourists there are still areas you can go where they arenâ€™t so many people. I wish we had learnt about the monkeys as we were visiting but there didnâ€™t seem to be much information.
Europe,"We had a really nice time walking around the monkey forest. There are dozens and dozens of monkeys running about the place! And they seemed to be friendly on the most part, the only time we saw them acting aggressively is when tourist tried petting them (I really donâ€™t know why people do this, even saw one guy repeatedly poke at a monkeys face with his finger!)

Nice jungle walk with some great views and some really cool looking trees.

It was fairly busy when we went (around lunch time) so we did find that there was a bit of a queue to use one of the bridges but only because people were trying to take photos.

"
Europe,"This place is great for half a day out it takes about for about 90 minutes to walk around the park, the entry fee is 100K (5.50GBP) for two people and the monkeys aren't afraid of humans, having said that though if you stare at them in the eye they will see that as aggression. Don't have any loose objects as they will eye them up and try to steal them."
Europe,"What a day, this place was amazing , monkeys every where even on top of my husband :) Definitely recommended"
Europe,"A must for any trip to Bali. Wild monkeys roaming the forest being cheeky. Keep your wits about you, they like to steal! ;)"
Europe,"I absolutely loved visiting here!!!! It is an amazing forest where you get to see where the monkeys hang out! What I love about it is the monkeys are free to roam in and out of the forest so it doesn't feel like a zoo or where the animals are trapped.

There are so many monkeys here playing, hanging out, eating and grooming - you'll see it all! The place itself is really interesting to walk around, there are lots of walkways and you do feel like you are in a forest, it's bigger than I expected."
Europe,"Definitely worth a see!
Our guide took us to the sanctuary and gave us an in-depth tour explaining all the temples and shrines and their various meanings.
The monkeys are roaming around freely and can get up close with you although you are advised to keep a distance as they may bite - but if left alone they will come up to you for a quick photo!"
Europe,"We went to this sanctuary as part of our best of ubud tour. A couple of minutes in and we saw our first monkey on the railing of the path. They are tame, even though they are technically in the wild and roam freely around the sanctuary.
If you love monkeys I would recommend to go, it is touristy but big enough not to get so crowded.
We didnâ€™t take anything but our camera in as we heard that the monkeys are known to take stuff off you, and we did see one try and grab a bag off someoneâ€™s back but didnâ€™t succeed!
We got some great pictures, especially when the baby jumped on my husbands back and just sat on his shoulders, it made his day!
The monkeys look well looked after and have feeding platforms throughout the sanctuary. Well worth a visit."
Europe,"We came here on 1st day in ubud and was good fun. I ignored the warnings about looking the monkeybin the eye, as I thought it was just precautionary advice...I was wrong. I starred the daddy straight in the core of his eye...and he wanted to rip my head clean off...scary little c u n t.
So...don't look them directly in the eye!

One negative...they don't sell bananas in the place...this is commercial suicide...you would generate so much more income if you had 3 of your staff selling bunches of bananas.

Very good place to visit though"
Europe,"Find your own path, enjoy the tranquility. Many beautiful sights. Be careful of the monkeys, they steal and fight. But they are very adorable. Lots of tourists but not overcrowded, yet!"
Europe,"Lots of monkeys jumping around, and as long as you take the proper measurements (dont try to feed or touch the monkeys, dont carry food on you) you can have an amazing time! Very informative too!"
Europe,"We went with our adult daughters and it was worth the visit. Although I am not sure if my daughter agrees with that as a large monkey was climbing all over her and went into her backpack, unzipped it and took her raincoat out of it!
The funny thing is she was the one who told us all the rules of what Not to do around the monkeys!
Put mosquito repellent on as you are in the forest. You can buy good smoothie, fresh juices and coffees at the main entrance!"
Europe,Very fun. The monkeys are harmless as long as you leave them alone. Beautiful setting. We walked right down to the very lowest part which was beautiful.
Europe,"This was one of the things top of my list to go and see in Ubud and it didnâ€™t disappoint, the ticket queues were quick and not too expensive. Friendly staff, the grounds are beautiful and of course there are plenty of monkeys, would definitely recommend!"
Europe,"It is a forest with monkeys and temples, what's not to like? You can get up close with the monkeys - but do exercise all due care and follow the guidance, these are wild animals. Go once while in Ubud."
Europe,"Great walk from our Hotel to the Monkey Forest. Once you have paid your entrance fee your free to walk around. Don't have anything loose or carry anything loose like water bottle as these monkeys will try and take anything. We witnessed them stealing a bracelet and emptied a man's rucksack. One of the babies tried to take my ring from my finger.
We walked around the forest to the temple. Amazing bridge in the middle. Toilets are very clean. We took about 3 hours to walk around. We even sheltered with some monkeys on a seating area to get out of the rain. Just a fun morning watching these cheeky monkeys."
Europe,"To say it was raining when we visited would be an understatement! This did affect our visit.... Thinking there may be some tree coverage or even undercover walkways for part of the trail, at least, we mistakenly parted with our cash and went ahead with our visit. In hindsight I would advise anyone thinking of visiting to wait for a dry day! The monkeys were cute, didn't hassle us much at all and were obviously looked after pretty well by their handlers. The weather made the trails muddy and wet, some became slippery and the monkeys went into the trees and under the occasional shelter to get out of the rain, so in reality we didn't see as many of them as we possibly might have. We beat a hasty retreat to a local coffee shop after 20 mins or so where it was much drier!!!"
Europe,"This is a nice place to spend 2 - 3 hours gently strolling around. The admission fee is very cheap (approx Â£3). The scenary even without the monkeys is spectacular in parts, lots of thick jungle, giant trees and spectacular mini waterfalls. The monkeys are the undoubted stars, but you need to be careful to follow all of the rules that are clearly posted throughout. Nobody was hurt whilst we were there, but our guide was quick to warn us that the monkeys can be aggressive if they are not respected. To be fair there were lots of staff on hand protecting both people and monkeys.I would not recommend this to anyone who had any mobity issues as it can be hard going with steps and bridges."
Europe,A good way to spend a couple of hours. The forest in itself is worth a visit. The monkeys are free to roam and looks as theyâ€™re healthy and happy. Went with 2 grown up children (early 20s) and everyone found the visit entertaining.
Europe,"Absolutely in love with this place!
If youâ€™re an animal lover but dislike zoos this will make your day!
So nice to see monkeys roaming free with not a cage in sight.
Watch your belongings though the cheeky devils will rob you of any thing they can get hold of!"
Europe,"Lovely place to visit and the setting is spectacular. Unfortunately a little ruined by the number of people there BUT it is not so much that it ruins the trip/visit.

On an ethical note, it does seem that this is a good place to go as you're not feeding the monkeys junk food, but good natural food. I liked that you were not forced to buy food to feed them, but instead you may want to tip the staff who kindly help to bring the monkeys close to you.

You'll get very close to the animals and spot more than just monkeys if you take your time to look and have an eagle eye. Also, read the instructions and follow the important rule of not looking into the monkeys eyes. If one jumps on you, don't turn around to look at it, as a friend or guide to shoo it off. If you don't resist the natural urge to look at it, you may get a bite.

The temples there are lovely too, but it is a shame that most of it was closed to visitors."
Europe,This is a lovely spot for a stroll around and watching the monkeys interact. Itâ€™s only somewhat spoilt by idiotic tourists who do not follow the rules and therefore put the monkeys at risk by giving them access to food they shouldnâ€™t eat and biting into plastic bottles to drink the contents.
Europe,"If you love monkeys, this is a must. They are absolutely everywhere and it becomes quite obvious that you are in their domain because you must follow their rules! The best bit, in my opinion, is the spring temple which has this beautiful stone bridge and lots of old trees. It looks straight out of a movie. Definitely recommend visiting."
Europe,Esay to get to and a fair entry fee. Lots of monkeys who given the chance will pinch your belongings! It is nice to see that the monkeys are well fed and cared for and even those with handicaps - one blind and one missing limbs are segregated off to keep them cared for
Europe,Well laid out and if you follow the path the visit should last about 1 hour. The monkeys here look very fit and seem very content in their environment. We recently visited Gibraltar and the macaques there are much more aggressive and aware of people whereas the monkeys here are much smaller and did not threaten anyone so it is very suitable to take children to visit.
Europe,"Enjoyed a morning wondering around the forest area. Watching monkeys roaming around the compound. Morning was relatively quiet but got busier as tours stopped by. Nice opportunities for photos as many statues dotted around and temple inside, even a temporary cemetery within. Well worth a visit"
Europe,"We had a good time here, a great way of spending an hour or two in Ubud and a must see if visiting.

The monkeys themselves were fascinating to watch and donâ€™t pay too much attention to you as long as you donâ€™t have any food or try to touch them. The younger ones tend to be a little bit more playful and might have a go at climbing up your leg but they usually give up if you carry on walking.

The forest itself is interesting and varied throughout, we didnâ€™t get bored of the surroundings at any point. There were quite a few toilets dotted about and there were quite a few members of staff on hand to help if anything were to happen.

Overall, a one off visit is well worth the price of entry, definitely shouldnâ€™t be missed.

"
Europe,Great experience for all ages. Lots of family monkey groups. Beware of your bags and water bottles. Water bottles wonâ€™t last more than 10 mins.
Europe,"We visited as part of a private tour, it is well presented and plenty of monkeys!! The monkeys are friendly a fun to watch, the forest is well signed and easy walking, well worth a visit"
Europe,"Worth while a visit allow about one and a half hours
We had no problems with the monkeys they kept themselves to themselves."
Europe,It was what you would hope. Part of a forest with some monkeys in it. Worth exploring all of the paths as thereâ€™s monkeys around every corner.
Europe,A pleasant shaded walk away from the heat and bustle of the main road. Loads of cheeky monkeys to see. A great project!
Europe,"Loved getting up close to the monkeys they were not aggressive in the slightest obviously used to seeing tourists.
I only saw one lady get some hankies snatched from her backpack but the attendants were quick to deal with it .
If you like monkeys I recommend you go.
"
Europe,"Visited here whilst in Ubud to see all the monkeys. It's bigger than I expected so that was a bonus, but sadly the place is too busy with tourists all heading there at the same time. I'd recommend a timing system to make visiting easier.

Only go if you are willing to respect the monkeys, there were so many tourists trying so desperately to take photos with them and they often end up getting aggressive. One lady I saw was so close to getting attacked but saved herself by spraying the monkey with water.

Do not take your rucksack unless you are happy for things to be taken my monkeys if you get too close!"
Europe,"Overall the forest was beautiful with different areas and can be completed within 1.5 hours or even one hour.
Need to be careful as if you do anything to provoke monkeys they will bite!"
Europe,Lots of fun - gorgeous scenery and greenery around. Grab some bananas and see what happens - cheeky monkeys will try to grab them off you. Really nice to visit a place where the animals are free to roam and we just merely visit and have a peak and try to interact with them!
Europe,"Despite the signs, these little beasts can be angry but only if you do stupid things around them, they are quite capable of unzipping a back-pack so don't take yours off, they will steal food also, don't intimidate them and enjoy a couple of hours walking around the forest :)"
Europe,We really enjoyed our visit. Just make sure the monkeys donâ€™t bite you and remain calm if they jump on you. We had a great time
Europe,The monkeys are nice to look at but inevitably exploited and looking for tourists giving them food. We saw a bunch of people get bitten so be careful!
Europe,"I was wary of going here but was swayed by the fact that it is run and owned by local people, who want to rescue monkeys. As a result, it has about 700 monkeys scattered within its confines. It is not a very large area but the monkeys don't seem to be overcrowded and they don't seem to be very troublesome, compared to some previous encounters with wild monkeys. This is probably because they are well fed and cared for. The trees in the park are very impressive and there are some old shrines scattered around. There is also an art gallery, showcasing paintings by some local artists."
Europe,Definitely worth going to see these guys monkey around. The temples within the monkey forest are worth seeing also!
Europe,"A must visit if you are heading to Ubud. Please make sure that you keep all of your valuables tucked away as the monk can be quite mischievous. Try and arrive early as the heat is quite oppressive and they also feed the monkeys in the morning.

"
Europe,"Really nice place, quite cool amongst the trees. Watch the monkeys they are thieves, follow the rules and donâ€™t look them in the eye"
Europe,"Monkey forest overall is nice experience, however, please do NOT bring any water in plastic bottles with you, or any paper as monkeys will try obtain them. Staff advised to hold bottle tight in case monkeys want to take it off from you - that is NOT a good advise - do not listen to that. In case you do have a bottle that monkey wants, give it to him straight away. I listened to staff's unprompted advise and got bitten badly by monkey until let the bottle go. Disappointed that staff would provide such advise to customers. Other than that, it is worth going."
Europe,"We took our 19month old son here in his buggy, stupid idea as there were far more steps than we anticipated but completely our fault.
Itâ€™s just meant carry baby and buggy.

Obviously monkeys are in the name... they are everywhere and will grab anything... especially in plastic so hide it or remove it.
We had a minor altercation with the biggest monkey we saw but once he realise my sons toy bag didnâ€™t contain food he gave up.

All in all well worth a visit ðŸ˜"
Europe,"A must see when in Ubud. Close to the centre of Ubud town, take the shuttle or a good walk along Jalan Monkey Forest to the Sanctury. Visit in the morning when its not so busy for better photo opportunities. be careful if you feed the monkeys they can become aggresive. Hold on to your belongings the are mischievious and like to grab at items. Later it gets very hot humid and can be tiring."
Europe,"This place is definitely worth a visit if youâ€™re in Ubud, but keep your wits about you.
The monkeys arenâ€™t quite so aggressive with tourists as they used to be, but they will still steal glasses, phones, hats etc if you donâ€™t keep a firm hold of them.
Itâ€™s a nice place to walk around and see the monkeys interacting with one another (in myriad different ways)."
Europe,"Forest is full of monkeys and they are very interactive, you see all types of monkey behavior. You feel like you are guest in their forest even if its located in a middle of the city. Not only you get to see monkey, but also architecture of the buildings is beutifful. If you are in ubud you should definitely visit it.
In title I have mentioned that is can be dangerous, simply because monkeys are wild animals and if provoked can attack you or steal stuff from a backpack, they are very sneaky.
We have witnessed monkeys doing both. One gentleman got attacked by monkey, but to monkeys defence he was invading monkeys personal space.
So if you follow the rules of the park you will be fine and enjoy your stays there. Also regarding the backpacks, we noticed that monkeys will try to open your backpack when you stand on a place or sit down for a prolonged time."
Europe,"Huge forest full of monkeys running, swinging and jumping around on the ground and in the trees. They come up to you and try and take loose items so be careful and dont look them in the eyes. Some of them were doing very funny things. Great place to visit and good price. Would definitely recommend."
Europe,"We visited the monkey forest and I have to say I have not seen anything like it. Itâ€™s a great place to take a walk and enjoy the greenery whilst seeing the monkeys. Be careful to take any food out as I took my sweets out of my bag and they were taken by a monkey ðŸ˜‚. If you are into the monkeys then Iâ€™d recommend this place. Itâ€™s unique and totally out of this world. Entrance fee was 80,000 rupiah so not bad."
Europe,"We attended early afternoon on a Friday. I canâ€™t remember the entrance cost but it was less than Â£10 . The park wasnâ€™t really full and there were hundreds of monkeys. Everything is well marked out, be careful that nothing is on show when walking through the sanctuary as the monkeys will literally rob anything. The monkeys were comfortable with humans getting close to them but there are the odd stroppy ones. As long as you follow all the instructions itâ€™s fairly safe."
Europe,Wow an amazing place with lots of monkeys be careful as they are very mischievous and will steal anything given the chance
Europe,"We visited here November 2019 and we were blown away by the walks around the Sacred Monkey Sanctuary. The place is beautifully looked after, and the monkeys are excellent. Great to see them in their natural environment."
Europe,"Had such a great time, monkeys are very friendly donâ€™t trouble you there very calm, really wanted a selfie with the monkey but was told
That has now stopped there, Not sure the reason why wasnâ€™t told why just told, They no longer offer that service"
Europe,"Amazing trip, the monkeys and staff were worth seeing, we spent hours there but could be done in an hour"
Europe,"Didnâ€™t think we would enjoy this with all the reviews of biting!! But we were here for 2.5 hours and easily couldâ€™ve done more! Incredible to see this animals up close
But to add to the warnings donâ€™t mess with the monkeys! They had my water bottle off me with the first few minutes and after fighting with another guest for theirs one went I get aggressive - simply hands off whatever theyâ€™re fighting for an donâ€™t move they will take what they came for an go away
Many signs about not running away or looking them in the eyes - you need to remember these are wild animals! 80kIDR entry and they do take card
"
Europe,"If you like animals, especially monkeys, this is a real must see if you are visiting Bali.

There are so many monkeys and they are all running wild. I would strongly recommend that you donâ€™t try touch the monkeys as they do bite and will jump on you. Quite a lot of them have babies and will be very protective of there young if you get too close. As they are living in this forest they are all wild monkeys and there are a few rules, one of the rules is not to make direct eye contact with any of them.

I would highly recommend visiting this place and it is very cheap to enter.

"
Europe,You canâ€™t go to Ubud without visiting this place. 1 hour to 90 mins is sufficient time to look round the whole place. Obviously lots of monkeys and the scenery is amazing. We didnâ€™t encounter any viscousness from any monkeys or saw anything happen to other visitors. They were happy playing with each other and not interested in tourists.
Europe,"We stayed next to the monkey forest during our stay in Ubud so we were used to seeing monkeys before we came here. Overall the monkeys were well behaved and I really liked the setting of the monkey forest - it was fun just to walk around. We had no issues of safety whatsoever but some people were being stupid and trying to antagonise them - please remember this isn't a zoo and these are unpredictable animals that will bite/scratch, especially if you try to touch the babies or take photos right in their faces. Also even if you don't behave stupidly, the monkeys can still bite or scratch you which is ofc a rabies risk. My friend and I were walking down the path alongside the forest, back to our hotel, one day, no food or drink on us and not interacting with the monkeys at all, and one jumped onto my friend's bag. Another time a monkey touched my leg.."
Europe,We visited here while holidaying In Bali - we found it to be so overcrowded and were told not to take food or drinks in with us as the monkeys would attack to take from you whatever you had - it was absolutely roasting hot walking round the forest an we were in desperate need of a drink so having seen the monkeys do what monkeys do we made an early exit .
Europe,"It's always nice to see a bunch of monkeys roaming about and doing what monkeys do... However
I would highly recommend not taking any backpack or bag, because these monkeys are the most unscrupulous little thieves. One of them jumped on my backpack, opened it and took out our wallet. He than disappeared high up in the tree and showered us in our own money. We did get it back in the end (by offering sweets, more tasting than bank notes).
Several other visitors had similar experiences, and we did see some very angry monkeys when someone tried to take back their stolen bag by force."
Europe,"We loved our visit at the Monkey Forest, the monkeys were fantastic to watch! We found the whole place very peaceful and enjoyable!"
Europe,"Lots of monkey in a jungle environment which you walk around for an hour and half on a pathed route . Little ones to bigger ones.. and great big trees reminiscent of one you would see in Harry Potter film.
Whatâ€™s not to like. Well worth a visit!

"
Europe,"Definitely a highlight of our stay in Ubud, lots of monkeys and a nice walk. We were lucky enough to see a mum and her tiny baby monkey and others monkeys playing, swimming and running around. Only saw one tourist have an incident with one of the monkeys but that was her fault for tapping her phone nearer and nearer the monkey!!"
Europe,Amazing place - been a few times. They have stopped letting you feed the monkeys - they have put a new entrance on and changed the feel. The monkeys will take and break stuff so just leave everything at home.
Europe,"The great thing here is the monkeys. They have no fear and itâ€™s fun watching them swim, eat, play, etc. sometimes they may get aggressive but just donâ€™t look them in the eyes and enjoy."
Europe,"Located just outside Ubud this place is well worth a visit and at only 80k Rupiah it certainly should be on every visitors wish list when visiting Bali. We visited first thing on a morning when it was a little bit cooler. The whole place is beautifully landscaped only takes about 90 minutes to walk around but the interactions with the monkeys are fantastic, just watch out for your valuables as they will take off with them."
Europe,"This place is amazing! Itâ€™s so lovely to just sit and watch the monkeyâ€™s do their thing but yes, they do grab you, your stuff, your hair and anything else they can find! Great to staff everywhere as well to protect both visitors and the monkeys. One of our trip highlights â¤ï¸"
Europe,Had a great visit here. Only takes about a hour to go around. I would advise going early in the morning due to the crowds - was quite touristy/busy when we went in the afternoon.
Europe,"This is a natural environment for the macaques and you are in their home and must respect that. They are still wild animals albeit amusing ones. They are fed well by the sanctuary and do not need anything else. There is a list of dos and donts when visiting which need to be followed. It doesnâ€™t take too long to go in and I feel best visited when in town and wandering around any way as really not too far to walk - about a 20 minute slow meander from the main road
They are little minxes. One wiley monkey approached a young lady from behind pulled at her dress and when she turned round, grabbed the drink she was carrying. We totally forgot we had a bottle of water in the side of the rucksack my husband was carrying. A monkey jumped up on the rucksack and pulled the bottle out and then proceeded to unscrew it and drink the water before being distracted by something else and moving away, allowing us to reclaim the bottle to put in the nearest bin."
Europe,"Whilst on a day trip visiting various locations around the Ubud district in Bali we took in the Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary in Padangtegal, Ubud.

Price per person is 80,000 Rp which is very reasonable, it is very worth while stopping of to visit the Monkey Sanctuary.

There is just over a thousand of the small Balinese long tailed Monkeys living in the Forest Sanctuary.

You could spend several hours in the Monkey Forest Sanctuary but as were on a day trip we wanted to take in more of the sights our driver had recommended so we spent around 90 minutes there.

Very good and enjoyable experience, you get really up close to the monkeys and if your fortunate or unfortunate you might get one the monkeys to jump on you or steal something from you.

Well worth the visit."
Europe,"Great experience seeing this awesome little people. They are so funny to watch
Just a shame no gift shop for funds to go towards looking after them"
Europe,"Went to the sanctuary October 2019, the monkeys roam freely amongst the general public, they are very inquisitive and jump on you to steal anything that is not fixed such as sunglasses bag a etc, they are particularly drawn to little children and are quite aggressive to them , my wife was unfortunately bitten while walking past an adult with two babies, it was quite frightening, went to the sanctuary hospital where there was one other lady in front of us with a bite , we were told that they are disease free cleaned my wifeâ€™s wound and then asked to sign and date an accident book, she was the 5th person to be bitten that morning, so itâ€™s a regular occurrence, so be careful when visiting especially with little children!!"
Europe,A good place to see loads of monkeys. Just don't take anything in with you. The monkeys are free and protected.
Europe,"Definitely recommend a visit! So much fun, and unbelievable to be that close to monkeys just in their natural habitat"
Europe,"Not usually a fan of zoo's or animals that are held captive however the sacred monkey forest is a unique experience in Ubud to see monkeys living freely, free to roam with no cages or bars.

Please read the instructions before entering the sacred forest as my husband decided to pull out a packet of nik naks rib and saucy (the purple bag), the poor thing didnt see it coming (not the monkey), before we knew it, a swarm of monkeys had created a 360 around him and started poking and prodding in his ""sacred"" area, there was no way for me to intervene, or even aid the situation. At this point I questioned our marriage and to why my husband would do such a thing..
IN A WILD MONKEY FOREST!
Long story short hes never worn shorts since and scarred from open woodlands.

A must see in Ubud!
"
Europe,"Iâ€™ve been to monkey forest twice. First time I was scared as they give you a list of rules before you get in. No food, no bags when you get in as the monkeys might just grab it thinking itâ€™s food. First time there were people selling bags of mangos in the forest. This time I didnâ€™t see any of that. Iâ€™m assuming something may have happened and apparently if your get a monkey bite Hospital costs could be more than what youâ€™ve brought in. Just enjoying viewing em and donâ€™t try to acknowledge them too much. Thereâ€™s clear instructions. Just follow them. My partner was so overwhelmed by them. It is a must do when your in ubud."
Europe,"Wow, this was definitely an experience to remember. Entrance fee was very reasonable and you can spend hours here exploring and taking pictures. The monkeys are free to roam around and can get aggressive if provoked. We didnâ€™t have any bad encounters but saw a few people touching the monkeys or getting too close to them which caused the monkeys to react! However some were super friendly and took pictures with people or just sat on their lap. Do not take any plastic bags as the monkeys grab these! Same with any food. We had a water bottle and a monkey grabbed it and opened it up and started drinking from it ! Was funny to see though and we didnâ€™t mind."
Europe,"Iâ€™m not a big fan of zoos and captive animals so donâ€™t normally visit this type of attraction but rest assured this place is neither of these. The monkeys are free to roam but appear to choose to live here, seem very happy and certainly have the freedom to do as they please. Well worth a visit because aside from the monkeys the venue holds its own interest."
Europe,"There are dozens if not hundreds of really tame monkeys all around the natural jungle park. Some are cheeky- trying to dip in pockets and backpacks, some are just resting, and some will sit on your lap!
A beautiful, natural setting."
Europe,"We loved our experience here, walking amongst these lovely inquisitive monkeys and their habitat. Well wort a visit you wonâ€™t be disappointed."
Europe,"Monkeys......rule, so keep this in mind, donâ€™t and I repeat donâ€™t ignore the rules, if itâ€™s there to grab, they will and then proceed to either put it in the bin ( 1 mans cap) or wipe it on themselves (1 womanâ€™s recent purchase)....just walk round, take lots of photos to upload and enjoy...."
Europe,"We booked to go here using Bali4u tours and our guide was brilliant, ( Iâ€™d highly recommend using the company as we had an amazing day).
The monkey forest was absolutely fantastic, I never stopped laughing, the cheeky monkeys steel peopleâ€™s water, they come up and touch you, go through your pockets and will climb over you. To me it was the best things ever, ( obviously wouldnâ€™t be fun to anyone scared of the monkeys).
There are park rangers who feed the monkeys which keeps aggression low, itâ€™s fab to watch them all come running when itâ€™s lunch time, they appear from every direction, some carrying tiny babies. Plenty of opportunities to get some great photos.
It was honestly the best trip Iâ€™ve ever been on, Iâ€™d highly recommend a visit and if I ever get the chance I will return.
"
Europe,We went in a group and had a really good time. The grounds were really beautiful and the monkeys went around freely which was good to see them in their home. Some were a little cheeky and stole a purse from a friends pocket but the wardens managed to surprisingly get it back! A good activity out of your not scared of these animals
Europe,There are over 1000 monkeys in the forest. You can view them being fed and follow them along the set route for visitors. Great fun and entertaining.
Europe,We have been coming to Ubud for many years and have seen the MF become more and more commercialised. Still well worth a visit though.
Europe,"Went on a day trip and this was the first visit of the day, it was really nice and the prices were good to, a nice walk around the grounds and monkeys are everywhere and a lot of the wardens around everywhere you go so they kept an eye on you also, very friendly and will talk to you and take pictures for you if you ask them to, plenty of places for selfies however a word of warning, please make sure your hand baggage is secured and nothing in the side pockets as they will try and get to whatever is loose. But generally as long as you respect that it is their home surroundings and life they will leave you alone and go about their natural daily business, you can buy them bananasâ€™ but they are well fed and looked after anyway, lovely walk around footpaths and arrows pointing into different directions and there are places where you can sit down and just watch them, there were a few mischievous ones that were quite funny and seemed that they were happy making you laugh and then the baby ones, be extra careful around the babies as the parents are not far off and they will protect them if they think that anytime they think that they are in danger. There are also feeding platforms for them and the wardens throwing food onto them.
Could have done with a half day at least there, we did a couple of hours but felt that we could have done maybe another good hour. Foot wear, I was happy with my flip flops for the day, there is a souvenir shop and you can get food there when you get back to the entrance
Overall a good time there, price good and highly recommended and we would go back again
Thank you"
Europe,"Visited the Monkey forest whilst in Ubud. Our villa dropped us off and although there seemed to be a decent amount of vehicles in the huge car park ,when we got inside it didnâ€™t seem crowded. The monkeys are mischievous and very savvy. They took the earring out of a guys ear I was stood next to. They love backpacks and can open zips and love to pinch water bottles. They can unscrew the tops or just bite the plastic for an easy drink. The signs warn you about all this and generally the smaller ones are the perpetrators. The natural setting in some impressive rainforest is worth the trip. As a top Bali visitor site, let alone Ubud, I can imagine it being very busy July & August."
Europe,I must admit I was not really looking forward to the Monkey Forest following reviews but it was a wonderful place that has been made into a lovely park and respectfully done up for tourists and locals alike. There were loads of monkeys and for the most part they were well behaved and lots of staff on hand if they did try to jump on you! We had a nice walk around the site and it took just over an hour to see most things. Would recommend.
Europe,Absolutely awesome with so many monkeys freely roaming around. Very well maintained and extremely cheap entry prices.
Europe,"As we were staying very close to the Monkey Forest and had seen the monkeys around the area we nearly didnâ€™t bother going into the sanctuary. But Iâ€™m so glad we did.
Itâ€™s very inexpensive to enter and worth double the money for the entertainment factor. We spent about 2 hours inside which I think was about right.
The monkeys are funny to watch and you can get right up to them but the funniest thing to watch are the people in there.
People sit next to the monkeys to get them to interact with them, climb on them to get a photo. But the monkeys are clever and undue the zips and get into back packs. Next thing the tourist starts to panic and try to get the monkeys off. Then the monkey gets angry and tries to bite.
If you respect itâ€™s their sanctuary and just watch them playing, they are friendly and wonâ€™t arm you."
Europe,"Very touristy but I really enjoyed visiting the monkey forrest. No problems with the monkeys, just don't have anything loose/any food and observe them peacefully and they're fine. Very cute to watch. Nice surrounds to the sanctuary too. We went later on in the day and it wasn't too busy."
Europe,best experience ever! I just loved the fact that the monkeys were able to leave or stay as and when they liked. most of the monkeys chose to stay there and have the food. staff were friendly and helped if a cheeky monkey jumped on your back and tried to steal from your bag. highly recommend to visit whilst in ubud.
Europe,"Not a surprise but it was very busy with tourists, not a problem though (though if you don't like witnessing clichÃ© photoshoots of people posing near monkeys then this isn't the place for you). Monkeys were surprisingly well behaved compared to other places we have seen monkeys. They are very comfortable in humans presence.
The scenary and park itself was beautiful and worth seeing."
Europe,"This is alot of fun. Over 1000 monkeys in the forest so you see them everywhere.

There are plenty of staff on hand to ensure everything is fine.

The monkeys are friendly buy not aggressive. Watch your pockets and bags as these guys know how to get into everything.

Cheap to get in and a few hours of fun.

Definitely check this place out."
Europe,"This is well worth a visit. The money's are adorable and absolutely everywhere. Really good fun to watch them play and see the babies as well. The only concern I had was tourists who were trying to tempt the money's to jump on them and people who took food and drinks inside despite being told not to, which the monkey's then stole and ate/drank. Was a really hot day the day we came here which was utterly exhausting so keep that in mind and be prepared if it's hot. Quite expensive for what it only a 2-3 hour experience but if you have children, not to be missed."
Europe,Great for a visit. See the monkeys (and babies) and temples in the forest. It was quite busy but worth a walk round. :)
Europe,Fun to see the monkeys roaming around. Rangers are happy to talk and answer your questions. Monkeys donâ€™t seem to bother you if you follow the rules. Didnâ€™t spend too much time here. We went as part of a tour so enjoyed the information we got from him. Not sure youâ€™d get that if you went on your own.
Europe,"I do understand how sometimes reviews can be damaging to a business and also deter people from visiting.

We almost skipped visiting this because of reading reviews about the monkeys biting and scratching, but what we learnt is if youâ€™re and idiot and donâ€™t follow simple instructions then yes you will get bitten or scratched.

We saw people have waters taken off them, food also being taken from bags. But it does say not to take any of this stuff in with you at the entrance. Theyâ€™re obviously going to find it it and take it. These are the people that are getting bitten and scratched. Also people getting to close and touching or encouraging the monkeys to jump on them.

If you go and do what youâ€™re supposed to, then you will not have issues. We had a lovely walk around the forest which I thought was well kept and the monkeys well looks after. Entrance fee was reasonable and the staff were all doing their job very well. We managed to get some great photos and thought it was worth the visit."
Europe,"Cool and fun place to spend 1-2 hours, but try not to go In busy period because can get very croudy.
In some spots you can take ""monkey selfies"". It really looks that monkeys are well treated and not used as tourist attraction."
Europe,"Nice place. Monkeys well looked after. As everything in Bali, expensive ticket entrance for what it is. You can get really nice pictures and come out of it unharmed if you follow the rules. Don't tip the workers! To tip is forbidden in the park but the workers will accept anything anyways..."
Europe,"The perfect balance of freedom to interact with monkeys i their natural habitat (at your own risk, with clear warnings - so its up to you how close you want to go), yet in a well managed and ecologically sound sanctuary - well worth a visit"
Europe,Sacred ground and nosey monkeys what can go wrong. Avoid taking bags and belongings if you can they love to try and take them.
Europe,"So itâ€™s a monkey Forrest and we knew it would be a little tough with a baby. We took both the stroller and body harness as we was unsure which would be more suitable.

The second we entered 5 monkeys were fighting around the pushchair which was a little scary. We then put the baby in the harness so she was protected which was a great idea because 2 minutes later a large monkey attacked the pushchair and started pulling out all the contents from underneath. The contents were only a sun cover / rain cover (no water or food). My wife abandoned the pushchair as more monkeys arrived. I dread to think how my wife would have reacted had the baby still been in the stroller because she would have literally had to fight the monkey to protect our little girl.

Our baby absolutely loves monkeys and for the 5 minutes we was inside (beside the trauma) she had a great time. I think the monkey Forrest is great for children but it is not advised with babies and strollers."
Europe,Thoroughly enjoyed a wander around the forest especially watching those a little braver or drafter than us.
Europe,"There is nothing wrond visiting the forest if you don't fed the monkey, and you don't wear a backpack. The forest is very nice to visit, to see the monkeys in their habitat."
Europe,"Great place to visit. Monkeys don't go around biting people and no need to be scared.

Only way I see them biting is if you bug them. We had no troubles here"
Europe,"A must visit when visiting Ubud!!
I understand that some people have been told by their tour guides not to visit as the monkeys are aggressive. This wasnt the case when we visited.
As long as you abide by the sanctuaries rules and guidelines you'll be fine.
The monkeys are entertaining and majority well behaved.
Yes, they will forage through your pockets or bags looking for food if they smell it. But they are harmless
One did get annoyed with me when I tried to turn off a tap that it had turned on to have a drink!!
But we absolutely enjoyed our visit the monkeys are well looked after and it's a truly beautiful place to visit.
You cannot visit Ubud without dropping in to visit the Monkey Sanctuary!!"
Europe,Surprisingly small- expected it to be a bit bigger based on what I'd seen in pictures. Very overcrowded which isn't ideal. The monkeys will make you laugh and your guides will say that they are free to do what they want but the guards definitely control them to an extent.
Europe,"We visited the monkey forest a few weeks ago, immediately a monkey tried grabbing a bottle of water off my husband. The forest is beautiful and theres 100s of monkeys to watch. We didn't get too close after reading too many stories about people being biten/scratched so we kept our distance. We really enjoyed ourselves but was wary the whole time. Saw a man heading to the medical centre with a bleeding hand and on our way out saw a monkey try to pull a woman's bag away from her, she looked pretty scared! It is a lovely place to visit but just be careful - they're very bulshy!!"
Europe,"If you can leave your bag in your vehicle. Even if padlocked and with no food in there, the further you go into the forest the monkeys might jump on you and try to open your bag. The forest is a great way to give the monkeys their space and protect them"
Europe,Great place to visit if you are in ubud. Monkeys are friendly and donâ€™t do any harm. Near to the town centre and other local attractions.
Europe,Great place to visit and walk arround monkeys well behaved. Plenty of staff on site. Would recommend if near Ubud.
Europe,"We came as part of our private tour. Costs about Â£5.00 to get in. Seemed to be quite busy, at the enterance, but as it covers about 40 acres, and with over 1000 monkeys here, it doesnot seem to be busy inside, and there are quiet areas to sit and watch the playful monkeys. Follow the rules, watch your glasses and bags, and dont make loud noises, or sudden movements, and you will be ok. get the famous monkey selfie, and tip the ranger. Lovely to see them roam so freely. Dont miss a quick look at the temples, but you cant go in, for the locals only."
Europe,"Wednesday 18th September and we walked from the centre of Ubud to the Monkey Forest, from the turning off the main road on to Monkey Forest Road was 1 kilometre. There was a sign on the roadside for the Sanctuary

Admission prices was 80,000 Rupiah per adult, roughly Â£4.70 each.

Having entered at the main lobby we passed through a cave and followed the pathway around the Forest. Our route took us by some interesting sites as well as encountering the inhabitants of the forest, the Macaque monkeys.

The forest covers an area of around 30 acres.

According to the information we were given there are around 1,060 monkeys living in the forest, where they roam freely. It was fascinating to see them up close, tending their young, swinging from the trees, playing, eating and so much more

The monkeys are so captivating some of the other points of interest are overlooked. There are the 3 Temples, dotted through the forest, Pura Dalem Agung (Main Temple) Pura Beji (Sacred Spring) and Pura Prajapati (Cremation).

We walked to the Holy Spring Temple, down the wooden steps then on the the Cremation Temple. We doubled back to gate number 2 and exited the Forest and took the road back into Ubud Town.

Visitors are requested to follow the rules, on display throughout the forest, for their own safety."
Europe,"The Monkey forest is a must do activity while in Bali! Tour guides will advise you to spend 30 minutes there but I would recomend taking your time and spending 1-2 hours. You can get very close to the monkeys and they are all around you minding their own business. Some people did push their luck trying to get pictures too close which angered the monkeys and there is really no need to get too close. There was a lot of walking involved but it was worth it as you got too see the wonders of a Bali forest as well as monkeys of all ages. If a monkey jumps on your backpack (which happened to me!) dont panic, just keep walking round and it will jump off. Ensure if you are going to take a backpack it is one the monkeys cant get into. I had a small zip up pocket which the monkey was able to unzip and take my contact lens case out of (I never got this back!). A really brilliant place to visit and I cant wait to go back!"
Europe,"Great place to visit, takes 1-2hours to see the whole place.

Monkeys are freely roaming around and will take anything if left, such as a bottle of water

"
Europe,"Had a fabulous time here today. The monkeys are very comfortable and just get on with monkey politics. Be wary of big males and mothers with babies, and donâ€™t make eye contact. The temples are very beautiful and the statues also. There is no taking food, which is just as well as you would be accosted. Really fantastic experience"
Europe,"Very good experience, just don't try and bribe the monkeys to sit on you with food or look them in the eyes directly, they will bite!"
Europe,We had a great day here and enjoyed close encounters with the monkeys. I would definitely recommend visiting while in Ubud. Plenty of monkeys to see and in a layed back environment. A nice walk around the temple and surrounding area.
Europe,"I loved the monkey forest, especially as there were sooo many babies! There are many interesting paths to walk and monkeys enjoying the forest everywhere. It was so fun to see them! Two tips: there are many different gates into the forest, so remember which one you entered by! And second, there's one wood pathway that is SUPER SLICK after it rains (I slipped and fractured my tailbone, ouch!)"
Europe,"Soo many Balinese monkeys. Worth visiting. Make sure you do not touch or feed them, they may be used to people but respect their wild animal status."
Europe,"The place wasnâ€™t expensive. Good to see the monkeys in the almost wild. The warning throughout the site do put you on edge a little. We saw a couple of monkeys taking stuff from people in an agressive manor.
An hour or so is plenty of time.
I definitely would not take a bag in there."
Europe,"So ofcourse we went to the monkey forest in Ubud. Everybody loves monkeyâ€™s right?

Little upset about how people do not care about the rules. Feeding the monkeyâ€™s with cookies and so on. Just dont, the rules are there for a reason. And trust me the monkeyâ€™s gets food so dont worry bout that.

And then i got upset beacuse they had a blind monkey in a cage, it Said on a sign that this is the best for the monkey so he can be in â€natural environmentâ€ and â€be with his kindâ€
The little monkey was all alone, couldnt see anything, it was really depressing to see him like that. But im not a vet, so i dont know.
For me that it not the best for an animal

And please PICK UP YOUR GARBAGE please"
Europe,"My husband and I visited in October 2019. An adult monkey jumped on my husbandâ€™s bag, I was standing next to him and the monkey jumped on me and bit my arm, I shook it off but it jumped onto my back and bit me another three times. Very scary and extremely painful. Staff advised me to visit the onsite clinic where a â€˜nurseâ€™ cleaned the wounds and applied antiseptic. I had to complete my details into a register. I was surprised to discover that the register was so full of many people that had also suffered from bites. This place should be closed to tourists. Not a nice experience. Bites are now purple bruises. Be careful!!"
Europe,Not a must see but very nice to have a walk in the forest. Lots to see. When you have extra time and you want to have a nice walk go here. Due to all the trees it's not so hot. The monkeys are hilarious
North America,"The Monkey forest is definitely worth a visit, lots of monkeys to see and a nice walk through the forest.

Lots of people but what attraction isnâ€™t a little crowded in Bali?"
North America,Guard your valuables and follow the park rules. There are monkeys everywhere and most are not scared of humans.
North America,It may seem touristy but how else are you going to see monkeys running free in nature without being deep in a jungle? After all it is a sanctuary. The landscape and waterfall give you a sense of what the rest of Bali is like. We thoroughly enjoyed our outing here and highly recommend to people of all ages and families.
North America,"We spent about and hour here (which was enough for me). Lots of monkeys, a few neat buildings and temples to look at.

Saw a naughty kid get chased by a monkey while his parents just let him run wild which wasnâ€™t appreciated (by us or the guides). But like the signs say â€˜donâ€™t chase the monkeysâ€™"
North America,"Awesome place to visit. The monkeys are free and well taking care of, my opinion. Its clean and easy to visit. Toilets are clean and easy to park."
North America,Beautiful place and wonderful experience and lovely to watch the playful monkeys playing and jumping around in water. Nice walk too but not wheel chair friendly but a clean walk. Temple is awesome but can be seen from outside.
North America,"We werenâ€™t going to go here after reading reviews of monkeys biting and scratching people but we changed our minds last minute after talking to our tour driver and were glad we went.
We were a bit scared going in but once we saw all the tourists and staff everywhere it put us at ease. The monkeys are everywhere and for the most part will leave you alone but we did have one jump on my fathers back pack and another jump on my daughter but thankfully no bites or scratches.

We spent about 2 hours there walking around and it was worth every penny.
Highly recommend"
North America,"The Monkey Forest is the site of 3 sacred temples, many beautiful statues, a lush landscape, and of course the best part - sanctuary to 900 Balinese macaques.
Respect the rules of the park and do not bring food in or attempt to interact with the monkeys.
I saw monkeys baring their teeth at some visitors getting too close for pics.
There are plenty of opportunities to view the monkeys from a close distance, and they are free to roam in & out of the park.
It's a beautiful place to wander & take it all in. We only had 1 hour to spend there but I easily could have enjoyed it for 2-3 hours."
North America,We visited this place and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Pay attention to the rules otherwise you risk unwanted attention from the monkeys. We respected the rules and had no issues. The monkeys were so sweet and hilarious. I was sitting minding my own business when a little one tried to get into my purse. He was easily shooed away. We got tons of cute videos and pics. Silly people who didnâ€™t mind the rules provided great entertainment as they were pestered by the monkeys.
North America,"We went to the Monkey Sanctuary the 2nd day we were in Ubud. We were a little nervous at first, but had a great time. The people working there are all very knowledgeable and kind. The monkey's roam free and you walk through the sanctuary. As long as you follow the rules everything will be fine. We loved going here! We easier found it with our GPS and our scooter."
North America,"This is a great way to see animals up close and in their natural environment. The sanctuary is open to the public for a small entrance fee. The monkey's are free to roam and play, the are treated well and not used for tricks or entertainment for tourists. You do have to be mindful not to feed them or carry any food with you because they will jump on you to get any food that you may be carrying. Great opportunity to take pictures up close. It's a lovely park to walk through, very picturesque. Bring lots of water."
North America,A wonderful and unforgettable experience. Everyone around us loved it and I highly recommend. It is a ten minute walk from ubud centre.
North America,"Highlight of my trip. The scenery is so beautiful but the animals even more so! They are mostly very friendly, just donâ€™t get too close. Be sure not to wear hat or glasses as they can take them. If you are calm and quiet you will have some really magical experiences getting up close to these wonderful animals! So worth the visit and would love to go back one day."
North America,great place to relax and see monkeys. they are funny animals. lots of nearby restaurants. food court was good. we spent about 3 hours there
North America,Lots of beautiful monkeys and scenery. The monkeys were interactive and fun to watch. Keep your bags locked !
North America,Great opportunity to see the monkeys from up close. They are not shy at all so do not leave anything in your pocket! They almost stole our bike's keys. Fun activity to spend a couple of hours in Ubud!
North America,"A beautiful walk through a forest sanctuary, complete with hundreds of
monkeys of all sizes and ages going about their daily routine. The monkeys are free to roam!! Well worth the visit for all ages."
North America,"I have been to monkey forest a number of times over the years and enjoy myself every time. The area is a beautiful place to walk around and you are guaranteed to see monkeys running and playing.

Now that they are no longer allowing people to feed the monkeys, the monkeys have gotten considerably less agressive/ curious and tend to keep to themselves, but be warned that dangling jewelry and water bottles might draw them in so leave those items at home or in your purse / bag."
North America,Very picturesue and the monkeys are well behaved as they are fed at regular intervals by the staff. Small charge for admission and they are part of the shuttle loop around Ubud.
North America,"We had a good experience in the monkey forest. They jumped on us and they also tried to open my bag (thank god I had a safepack bag). I recommend going there but locals told us that those monkey are aggressive compare to other monkey in bali because they feel a lot of competition between them as there are many monkeys an also they don't have enough food. We went to mount batur where we also saw monkeys and it's true they were less aggressive. Over all I think the monkey forest is still worth it because it's not just about the monkeys but also seeing the statues, temples and the forest. I recommend it :)"
North America,"Loved the monkey forest but be aware that the monkeys can be aggressive. One of them climbed up and sat on the shoulder of one of our party, then urinated on him! The staff warn you not to try to pull or push them off as they can bite. Be warned. Beautiful forested location with amazing huge statuary throughout. A very pretty and kind of spiritual place to walk."
North America,We really enjoyed visiting the Monkey Forest! These monkeyâ€™s are well fed and cared for and it shows. The monkeyâ€™s donâ€™t seem to care about the people walking around. They just play and react with each other as though people arenâ€™t even there. We loved seeing all the new baby monkeyâ€™s. So cute. The most fun was watching them play in a cement water pond. It was like watching a monkey pool party!! They were jumping in the water and wrestling with each other like kids. HilariousðŸ˜€
North America,"We just really loved this place. The kids (7 and 4) along with us adults found this place really neat and entertaining. Very well set-up place, easy to get around and beautiful environment. The monkeys can be dangerous and are known to steal stuff but follow the rules they have outlined and you'll be fine. Took us about 1 hour to see everything with kids in tow."
North America,"We enjoyed our visit to the Monkey Forest although we had a healthy fear of them! We took many videos and photos but found it hard to take a good picture, while avoiding eye contact with the little rascals.... as was warned on every sign we read."
North America,"Really excellent place to visit. Definitely spend time at the centre point (where there is a pond) and at the ampitheatre near the exhibition hall (where there is a moat with water). If youâ€™re lucky, youâ€™ll see monkeys jumping into the water and swimming (much like otters.) It was amazing to watch. The forest is well shaded so itâ€™s pleasant to stroll there and the staff ensure monkeys donâ€™t hassle guests. Do not carry water bottles or other loose items in your hands. The monkeys do like to grab things. The ones near the exhibition hall did this the most. So itâ€™s a learned behaviour in that group."
North America,Here is a fun walk through a lush indonesian forest with hundreds of pesky mischevious little monkeys. Some not so little by the way. They are very clever and will steal anything they can get their hands on but it is still an enjoyable experience to interact with them. do not carry plastic bages from town as they have figured out there is something of value in them and you will never make it to the other end of the park. I didn't know monkeys liked water but you can watch them swim and dive in to several large fountains.. Such a great experience.
North America,"This is a lovely forest sanctuary for the macaque monkeys. It is beautiful to walk through the forest and temples and be entertained by the antics of the monkeys. There are many to view young and old alike. They might try to grab your water bottle or sunglasses but if you just pull away they leave. Not a good idea to let them climb on you, tease them or feed them. We witnessed this a few times and cringed as we know they can bite as they are still wild animals. Please respect them and you will love this walk with the macaques."
North America,"My friends and I really enjoyed the monkey forest! It was really fascinating to be able to walk the grounds and see all the monkeys roaming free. The little babies were sooo cute! The grounds were stunning as well, so many gorgeous stone carvings. I was a bit worried at first as I was told the monkeys could get quite aggressive but they kept to themselves for the most part and we had no issues. Keep your glasses/hats in your purse/bag though - they love them some accessories :p would definitely go again and would definitely recommend:)"
North America,"Second visit at the Monkey forest. Interresting and funny to observe all monkey. Nice enrironment,in a beautiful forest."
North America,"We did a short visit to the monkey forest. It was great to see all the monkeys and we even saw a huge monitor lizard. The monkeys are free but choose to stay due to offerings and feedings. We saw mothers with tiny babies, huge alpha males and everything in between. Saw monkey fights, mating, eating, playing etc. my teenage son even got pooped on .... I suggest bringing paper towels and hand sanitizer, just in case. Definitely worth a visit."
North America,"I was quite scared to go here after reading reviews of people getting bitten but we had a nice experience. I think just don't try to interact with the monkeys, pictures only. Lots of babies."
North America,"We were here last August and the monkey forest was part of one of our day tours. Make sure you have your camera ready to take some great photos with the monkeys. They are mischievous little rascals, so secure your sunglasses as they will try to snatch them from you."
North America,"It is what it says - a forest with monkeys roaming free. They might jump on you, so be aware of your actions and surroundings. The forest is located in a gully and gets warm and the air is close."
North America,"They paved paradise
And put up a parking lot......Joni
Over the past 2 years, one half of the beautiful forest has been paved over to accommodate the increasing tourism demand.....and the monkeys appear angry."
North America,Do it! So special and we and our children ages 4 and 10 loved this experience. Many babies and their mother monkeys to see and lovely men taking care of them who answer your questions. All in a very beautiful and serene environment
North America,"Very fun visit. Kids loved the monkeys and it was shaded from natural trees which made the walk around nice.
Interesting to learn about the history.
Well organised.
Would come again."
North America,"Have seen many kinds of monkeys in my travels all over the world, and I must say that these guys are not very appealing, and yes, some are aggressive. The park is pretty enough, but I suggest that if you want to see monkeys, and for free, just drive along the beach road to where the boats go to Manjangan Island and you can see a whole bunch of monkeys routinely fishing every day."
North America,"We seriously LOVED this sanctuary! Monkeys are out and about, roaming around! They will go in your purse so be sure to keep closed tightly! They may also take your shades! Lol! You can get food inside from care takers. The monkeys will climb all over you if you sit still and offer them some food! Itâ€™s a nice walk through the forest as well. Grounds are maintained, and beautiful! The tiny babyâ€™s are just so cute, I could hardly stand it!!! Be prepared to spend some time and take tons of pics! When you enter, there are rules posted about behaviour... important to read these carefully and follow them. Donâ€™t show signs of aggression or show your teeth are the ones I remember... otherwise there is a chance they could bite. Worth the visit! So fun!!!!"
North America,"...And you want to get up close to a bunch of macaques, then this is a good place to see them. If you are afraid of semi-wild animals who may climb on you or bite you, then give it a miss."
North America,"Not only did we enjoy being so close to the monkeys but we also enjoyed the beautiful and very mature forest.

Thereâ€™s a beautiful river that flows through the forest which is also really nice.

We visited the monkey forest two times in our fours days that we were in Ubud.

The cost to enter was 50,000 and they recommend not taking any bags into the park as the monkeys are very curious. Sooooo do your shopping after your visit!

Enjoy"
North America,"We to monkey forest , enjoyed walking through. Lots of monkeys looking to steal food so don't bring any with you. Best to not take a back PAC as the monkeys watch for them. We did not have any food so they did not bother us. The walks are very well kept. Monkeys all look very healthy."
North America,"Several reviews mentioned watch out for the monkey they steal your bags, glasses, etc. We didn't encounter any of this activity and saw all of the monkeys playing, eating, very social animal, people all around to ensure the monkeys are protected as well as the guests. Some people had a money on there back pack which they like but they were encouraging the monkey so leave them alone and you will be fine. Lots of opportunity to take great photos."
North America,We had Putu from â€˜Bali sun tour guideâ€™ take us through the monkey sanctuary. It was a great experience having Putu show us around and explain the statues to us and the meaning of each garden. Monkeys are well taken care of and free to roam. Strongly recommend visiting when in Ubud
North America,"The Monkey Forest in Ubud is a must see. This beautifully kept wildlife preserve is filled with over 600 monkeys. These little furry primates may be used to humans, but extreme caution must be taken. Follow ALL the rules, and even then, accidents can happen. I followed all the rules, but was still attached by an older male. It happened quickly and Iâ€™m alright (surface scratches and a massive bruise on my right arm), and I am very lucky. The first aid station took very good care of me, cleaned my wound and gave my antibiotics as a precaution. If you have young children - DO NOT let them wonder. A small boy ran towards the monkeys and I caught him before he could get attacked (and took one for him instead).
Donâ€™t let this scare you - I have no regrets and loved almost every minute of it. I highly recommend this for everyone (unless you have no control over your small children, then do not go)."
North America,The place is filled with monkeys and they're all the same type. You can see them across the road before you enter. Go only if you really love monkeys. Its stroller friendly for most of the area - though not all. A few places aren't accessible but it was better suited than most places in Bali.
North America,I felt a little OnGard the whole time I was there which is not a bad thing. People were feeding the monkeys and petting them and trying to pick them up. Three people get bitten a day and I saw one lady get bitten after picking up a monkey. As long as you obey by the rules you should be safe.
North America,A must see if you are going to Ubud. My kid loved seeing all the monkeys and would have ran to them if I let her ;)
North America,"This is a beautiful forest, easy to get to. The area is suburban/rural. The monkeys are fascinating and the forest is beautiful. The park is very clean and well maintained. There are many rules to read up on when visiting for your own benefit. We saw many issues because people didn't follow the rules. Don't bring anything you don't need inside. Including packs, jewelry, water bottles, loose clothing, food. Best to keep your eye glasses in your pocket and pull them out only when monkeys are not near."
North America,"Great to see animals in their â€™natural' environment. When I visited there were about 850 animals in the forest. Its really hot and humid in the forest. While we were there one of the monkeys grabbed a bottle of water from one of the visitors
Visited this as part of a tour"
North America,"Very well maintained sanctuary where you can get up close and personal with the monkeys. Don't take food in there as they will try to steal it also keep a hold of your glasses and cameras. Lots of little babies...so cute. Lovely to see them in their natural surroundings. We went twice during our stay in Ubud, it's that good."
North America,"I would have paid triple the entrance fee for this experience. We stayed hours watching our ancestors, their play and their antics. You will love this but pay attention to the rules. The monkeys are not afraid of you and they will jump on you and try to snatch a purse, water bottle, plastic bag, shiny necklace, backpack...anything that they can grab. This is funny when it's happening to someone else, but not so funny when it's you. So follow the written rules. You can also watch them being fed at various stations. There are handlers throughout who are more than happy to answer questions. This place is delightful and the monkeys deserve your respect. Definitely a must see!"
North America,"Spent almost two hrs walking through here. Lots of monkeys, everywhere. Some beautiful pathways. In the heat of the day you get a fair amount of shade amongst the trees. Nice walk."
North America,Very exciting but scary at the same time! The monkeys are unpredictable and will jump on you on any given time! You just have to follow the rules listed around the sanctuary. Great experience
North America,This was so much fun lots to see and lots of monkeys everywhere. Was a bit nervous at first but then it turned out to be perfect !!
North America,"We visited the Scared Monkey Forest Sanctuary and enjoyed every moment. The monkeys were very friendly and adorable. If you are in Ubud, this is a must-visit."
North America,"Very beautiful place with lots of monkeys that are totally in their environment. Many posts say to buy bananas but DONâ€™T. They have signs every where not to feed monkeys.
Monkeys are busy playing chasing and fighting amongst themselves that they donâ€™t seem to care about all the people.
Beautiful sculptures and temples."
North America,"I do try to stay away from overly touristy attractions and I have seen a lot of monkeys in the past however, we had friends in town who really wanted to go to the Sacred Monkey Forest so we headed over.

The entrance fee was $80K per person. The sanctuary is larger than I expected hosting a number of temples as well. They do not want you to bring any plastic bottles or paper bags in as the monkeys will snatch it right out of your hands and it leads to garbage in the park.

It was very interesting to see the monkeys interacting up close. They have this strange habit of rolling rocks on the ground. I'm not sure if they think they are nuts or they are trying to polish the rocks. They will even go and get leaves to protect their hands as they roll the rocks. It was quite interesting to watch.

The sanctuary is also home to a cemetery for those who live in in what is considered the village (about 5,500 people). One of the employees told us that when people die, they bury them there until it is time to do the mass cremation which happens every 5 years. The last mass cremation for the village was in August so there won't be another one for a long while and I can imagine it might get a bit crowded!

Overall, I was quite impressed at how interesting the experience was. It was busy but not too crowded and it was a nice way to pass an afternoon."
North America,I am not a big fan of monkeys because you never know what to expect from them. They are cute and everything but as you are walking be mindful and make sure to have all your belongings near you otherwise you might lose your sun glasses/phone/snacks/bag. :)
North America,"This place for sure is a must see in Ubud, totally exceeded my expectations. Great stone work everywhere, monkeys all over the place and a nice and clean forest to walk through. I just loved it ! I will be back some day, 100% recommended.
NOTE: Please remember to DO NOT feed or provide water to the monkeys !!!! PLEASE! We saw 5 ""adults"" throwing their water bottles at the floor to attract more monkeys... what a shame! if you are not willing to follow the rules, please do not visit this beautiful place!.Let's show RESPECT for ourselves and others, please! My husband got so frustrated with this people that he preferred leave the place ðŸ˜”"
North America,"A must see and enjoy.

You enter their dominion and make sure you mind your steps and movements. Read all the warnings. And treat animals with respect and care. That's all.

Can do it on your own. Absolutely. No guides needed. The forest is packed with staff who are on every corner or, better say, are next to every tree. Protecting animals... from the tourists and vice versa. They will rush to help you too if a monkey somehow overcomes you.

No food
No hats
No glasses
No plastic bottles
I.e. no loose or shiny objects, or anything reflecting the sun light
Hold your phone's really tight! They'll take it from your pocket. Seen that happened to a tourist, but monkey dropped it.

I crouched down by the monkey when another visitor was taking a photo of me. And a mommy with a baby hanging off her belly appeared from nowhere and picked an eyeglasses wipe from a tiny outside pocket of my sling which I was wearing across the shoulder! I did not even see her! And we were only warned about no food?! That thing is not even edible! I was not going to fight, she touched it already for goodness sake and no need to make an animal angry... that's first. The mommy reaped the foil open in a second...

Loveliest photos and videos. Overwhelming cuteness :)"
North America,"Very affordable, very relaxing scenery, and the monkeys are very interesting to watch. Monkeys are for the most part pretty calm but a monkey took my daughter's water bottle and another tried to take my hat so be aware of any loose items. Right downtown ubud so very accessible by foot."
North America,Lots and of monkeys of all different ages. Shaded walk through the park. Be careful as the monkeys seem to look for food and shiny items and at least one of them will find what they are looking for so beware. Fun walk in a park.
North America,"I had three monkeys jump on me right at the entrance... once they realized I had no food they hopped off. The rest of the monkeys inside were better behaved! Nice shady walk with cool and cute monkeys all around! If you go with kids, keep em close and discourage them from running!"
North America,"It is really cool , lovely place to visit , lucky the weather is not too hot , lot of monkeys running around ,very friendly ,I am so lucky meet the King of the monkeys also the grand mother too .,very safe and clean place to visit ,I have one baby set on my head over 5 mins ,"
North America,"Great price, cool statues and history with so many monkeys! Loved this area and would definitely visit again."
North America,It was wonderful to see all the monkeys and the large area they live in! I recommend this to anyone visiting Ubud! Just give the monkeys their space and you'll be ok!
North America,"Before heading to the monkey forest I read up on the rules & policies.
-Do Not smile showing teeth - it is a sign off aggression
-Do Not pet the monkeys
-Do Not feed the monkeys
-Do not bring any food or what may look like food - the monkeys are trained to get what they want at any cost
Darn Monkeys!!
There were monkeys everywhere Some posed for the camera while some of them paid you no mind. There were playful monkeys and some that were on a mission to find a snack.
It was amazing to see them interact with one another & just how smart they are.
"
North America,"It was very nice to walk around monkeys.
The forest is beautiful and give a lot of shade
Don't bring plastic/paper bag or water bottle. Monkeys love them."
North America,"I had been to the Monkey Forest twice before and it never fails to impress me. It really is a must if you go to Bali. Just keep your wits about you as the monkeys are wild and a few people got bit while we were. Donâ€™t bring anything shiny...jewelry, water bottles, etc. And, whatever you do, do NOT make eye contact. I made that mistake and seriously pissed off a monkey. Thankfully he decided not to attack but it was dicey. Monkeys also seem to be attracted by backpacks...probably because some people bring food in them. Donâ€™t bring any food or snacks and definitely donâ€™t feed them. If they grab something...water bottle, sunglasses, etc...best to let them have it. If you do get bit or scratched, there are clinics scattered around the grounds. The one we saw had a few customers.

You also have to watch your step for monkey poop bombs that are on the ground.

Despite all of this, you must see it. You will most likely never see anything like it again. The monkeys are fascinating and the temples are stunning."
North America,"This was a highlight of our trip to Bali. There are planets of macaques to keep you entertained, and the trails are good quality. Accessibility may be an issue for this with mobility problem. Go early to avoid the crowds. Do not feed or touch the monkeys because you can transmit fatal or life threatening viruses to them. The monkeys are not aggressive, nor are they fearful. You will have ample opportunity for close up photos but avoid the temptation to try to touch them."
North America,"We were skeptical and wondering if it was really worth itâ€¦ But every one who had been, told us we needed to see it. It is a nice park to walk around, with many trees and temples, but the monkeys really bring the police to life! He is really interesting to watch them interact with each other, it was very entertaining!"
North America,"I walked to the Monkey Forest, after just staying down the street. There are alit of Monkeys! They donâ€™t seem to bother with phones or sunglasses, but DONâ€™T take in food or water. I took a bottle of water in with me and was approached multiple times with one monkey BITING my elbow when I refused to give it up. Lucky for me the skin wasnâ€™t broken, but this guy was Nasty! My advice is to not take anything edible or liquid with you. And yes this is also clearly stated on the signage going in to the forest."
North America,My husband loved this experience and I did too but it was my second time visiting so I had seen it all before. We got some great footage and imagery and I done some more walking around with my husband this time round. A monkey stole my water which I found quite funny.
North America,"Foreground grounds, cute monkeys, not expensive excursion. Warning- monkeys will jump on you and/or take your stuff !"
North America,"Just a word
Beautiful.
Just don't look the monkey in the eye, and don't panic if one of them get in your shoulder"
North America,"I really loved this place, I canâ€™t get tired of watch the monkeys steal everything they can, if you enjoy to watch animals you can spend hours looking to these funny thieves.
It is a must if you in Ubud, it is a natural atmosphere but you have to be alert of your belongings, put everything on a safe and tight place, but de careful with the zippers, monkeys can open easily, if you have bottles of water in the hand they are going over you.
There are locals selling bananas , watch out cause you can be ripped off by a gang of monkeys."
North America,Today I went to the monkey forest. The park is beautifull. However when I went to an more quiet path of the park I got attacked by an monkey. He ripped my dress!! 2 monkeys got in me and one ripped my dress.
North America,I had a blast visiting the Monkey Forests you can interact with monkeys but you have to be careful don't bring food because they steal everything from you and they also try to open your backpack if you are distracted. Don't even try to touch them specially baby monkeys because they might bite you. The place is beautiful for pictures.
North America,Being able to share the Forest with monkeys itâ€™s a great experience. The ruins inside the vegetationâ€™s and the tracks. Makes this a great 2 hour thing to do in Ubud
North America,"The day I went, the monkeys were cranky. I'm a bit afraid of monkeys at the best of times, so I advise, go with caution."
North America,"Excellent for all age groups. Great for those who love wildlife and of course monkeys ðŸ’
I highly recommend when in Ubud."
North America,"After reading the recommendations on the Monkey Forest website and reviews online, we expected to have to be very cautious of monkey contact. We read monkeys have been more aggressive in recent years. Our experience was quite the contrary.

The staff is very attentive and helpful. The grounds are very well marked, with maps and clear signeage, and lots of informative boards around.

The monkeys are lovely and mind their own business, even when walking very close to them. Only if you get too close or invasive of their space with cameras will they hiss and show their teeth, which is a sign that they are feeling threatened and an indication that you better move away and leave them be. It is delightful and tirelessly entertaining to watch the monkeys interacting and doing their thing, especially the babies.

The grounds are very well taken care of, the temples are beautiful, the nature is breathtaking, and the toilets are very clean and well supplied with toilet paper and soap.

We saw two events of monkeys on people. The monkeys were interested in shiny things: a zipper, and clothes buttons. In one of the cases, the person tried to shove the monkey away and the monkey bit her lightly, but nothing major. She confirmed it was like a warning or playful gesture from the monkey. In the other case, the monkey was very enthralled with the shiny zipper and got tangled in the woman's hair. There was no aggression and the monkey eventually detangled and went on his way.

We were very pleased to see that the monkeys roam free, are well fed, and are treated with respect. One of the staff noticed a monkey had a wound on his chest, and the staff member was immediately taking pictures and calling on the radio to report the monkey's condition. It is evident that they do their best to care for the monkeys and conserve their habitat. We really enjoyed our visit, and wished there was more to explore; we wandered around and were captivated for 2 hours."
North America,"The monkeys are amazing and really funny, besides that, the temple and forest is mind blowing, really peaceful place.
We took some photos with the monkeys, simulating a selfie with them."
North America,Fun! And great landscapes. Very nice to watch the monkeys in their own environment. Would recommend it!
North America,We didn't do a tour we just walked there from the hotel we were staying at. Took about 20 minutes. It was spectacular. When the sign says make sure to put everything away they really mean it. We watched the monkeys grab stuff that people had attached to the outside of their backpacks from hand sanitizer to water bottles. Being able to walk and have the monkeys right by our feet or up in the trees was very cool.
North America,"I was a little nervous about visiting the monkey forest, having heard tales of their mastery of extortion and aggresive nature. In the end, it was totally fine. Two seconds after entering the forest my husband had a little monkey grabbing his leg and eventually climbing up his back to grab, bite and pull at his necklace. There are signs and even guards all over that warn against interacting with the monkeys but when the monkeys WANT to interact with you, all you can do is stay calm and wait for them to wonder off.
This visit proved to be quite the experience; EVERYWHERE we looked there were monkeys...babies, mamas and then the big alphas. This place provides such a unique experience that is worth seeking out. My kids loved it!"
North America,Monkeys very tame and cute-I got a lot of good pictures of mother and baby pairs-make sure to take off glasses-they will be lifted-I saw it happen.
North America,"I was so excited to go to the Monkey Forest. That was until I got there. I was terrified and Iâ€™m pretty adventurous. There was monkeys everywhere. They wonâ€™t mess with you if you donâ€™t mess with them, beware of their tails. I was told people are most frequently bitten for mistakenly stepping on their tails. One of my friends got really comfortable and allowed a few of them to crawl on him. Unfortunately, he did get bit. Their medical center on site said every money had their rabies shots (thereâ€™s over 900 monkeys there). He stated the numbers on the monkeys were to prove it. The monkey that bit my friend had no number on it. He did get sick upon our return to the US."
North America,"Wasn't sure what to expect and almost didn't go because we saw some monkeys playing around the street near the Sanctuary. But we had some free time, the admission wasn't expensive and weather was bright so we went. I am glad we did. I liked the whole environment with the monkeys playing in the fountains, trees, temples, well....everywhere. We spent more time than i thought we would and enjoyed a nice stroll. HINT: make sure everything you are carrying is tucked away....the monkeys are curious and will snatch what ever they can. Oh and one actually crawled up to my shoulder to try to get my purse. Silly little guy. Fun 1-2 hours!"
North America,"Finding the parking lot was a bit of a struggle for us but once we found it we walked a bit and got our tickets in. What an amazing time, a highlight for both my husband and I! One of the monkeys even jumped from a wooden bridge we were standing at onto my shoulder and picked at my hair (I had French braids in). So fun, and great photo opportunities.

Take caution where you sit and rest, we almost got peed on!"
North America,"Hours of enjoyment of watching the monkeys frolic and play and steal water bottles from people. One courageous large monkey crawled up my body, Jumped onto my backpack and unzipped it to search inside for a water bottle that I did not have. He removed all my belongings from backpack and then ran off to look for another victim. No harm was done, but we had a good laugh.

So if you bring a water bottle be prepared to have it stolen. It was a wonderful day!"
North America,"A highly anticipated spot, the Ubud Monkey Sanctuary is this charming forest, literally in the middle of Ubudâ€™s center. As you drive past it, often local monkeys can be seen hanging from the trees and even crawling through the cityâ€™s streets. One of our close friends told us that the Monkey Forest was a must but that we should be cautious because the monkeys can be quite â€œfriskyâ€. We were surprised by this statement, but it was completely accurate. The monkeys have been conditioned to all the people and attention - so much so that they expect to be fed and will lift things from you. Anything that can be easily removed should be properly stored or simply just left at home - sunglasses, water bottles, phones, etc. One of the monkeys stole our water bottle from my husband's pocket.

Also, its important to note that these are wild animals so poking/prodding is NOT advisable. Its estimated that 120 visitors a day get bit by these monkeys in Ubudâ€™s Monkey Forest. I was one of them. My dress had small embroidered holes in it, and a monkey that was passing by got one of its paws stuck in my dress. It was upset by this and started pulling on my dress. When I turned around and realized what happened, I instinctually said No! Like I was talking to a puppy. It in turn bit me. The entire thing happened so fast, it surprised me. I immediately visited the First Aid Center on site and cleaned my wound. Thankfully the bite was superficial and there was no blood, but the experience was pretty terrifying to be honest. I love animals and have never been scared before of a dog or swimming with dolphins. This definitely made me think twice. I would not recommend this for people traveling with small children. According to the staff member at the clinic, there have not been any reports of Rabies in the monkey forest, and the doctor on site tests the animals for Rabies. That being said, these again are wild animals that do not seem to be tagged so they can't insure that these animals do not have diseases. Go at your own risk!"
North America,"Came here with my partner. It was very cool to see all of the monkeys. We were very mindful of all of the guidelines to avoid aggression from the monkeys. We were standing on a walk way, quietly watching the monkeys. One came up behind my partner, very calmly, and bit her in the back of the ankle. We went to the first aid. The man there was very friendly. But, I have some criticism: the general guidelines of cleaning out a bite from an animal includes washing out the wound under soap and water for 10-15minutes. Iâ€™d say they cleaned it for 2-3 at most. I asked numerous questions regarding rabies, infections, frequency of bites. We were told â€œmany people get bit.â€ At least one a day, if not more. He simply said that the monkeys donâ€™t have rabies or infections, without providing any real evidence. They soon sent us on our way. We felt the information we were given was inadequate. The monkeys roam in and out of the forest, where there are also many dogs around (thereâ€™s been a big outbreak of rabies in dogs here). After some research, we decided to go to a local clinic, where they immediately began rabies and herpesvirus b prophylaxis... without hesitation. This clinic expressed that they have people coming in every day with monkey bites. And they highly recommended treatment, because despite there being no recent cases of rabies or herpesvirus b (also lethal if untreated), we just donâ€™t know where the monkey has been and if it is healthy. It is not worth the risk. I also asked my self: maybe local clinics treating bites is the reason we havenâ€™t seen any diseases/viruses passed along. Itâ€™s a cool place to go. But be aware: following the guidelines certainly does not guarantee that you will not get bit. I wouldnâ€™t bring a child. Definitely seek medical attention if you get bit, it not worth the risk at all."
North America,"If you are in Ubud do not skip Monkey forest. But one piece of advice is to tie your hat onto your head, because the monkeys will try to steal your hat, and they are sneaky about it. Take your camera, this is a really cool place."
North America,This is a must do when visiting Bali. It is such an experience to be so close to the monkeys and just watch them. Donâ€™t take food or plastic in and follow their guidelines. We got the experience of seeing a ceremony during our visit.
North America,This sanctuary is a must see. It is fully shaded from the hot sun and a very easy walk for all age levels and/or strollers. The monkeys are always entertaining if you use caution and remember that it is their home.
North America,"Fun few hrs walking around checking out the monkeys. Super cute and pretty friendly, just follow the directions. Definitely worth it if you are in the area!!"
North America,"If you like monkeys go here. Yes, they might climb on you and pick through your bag. I got bit when I tried to get a monkey off me because it thought I had something in my bag (I didnâ€™t). Bite was minor. No broken skin and was more of a warning bite based off of the teeth they have. Insect spray is advisable. Would do again!"
North America,We loved this forest! The baby monkeys were so cute! Lots of monkeys to see but you gotta be ready for them to touch you and maybe even jump on you! Great experience with our little baby
North America,"You get to see about every aspect of the macaques here. There are baby monkeys playing, adult monkeys preening and grooming others and everything in between. I also enjoyed the temple and the statues in the park."
North America,"I was a little hesitant to visit because Iâ€™d heard the monkeys were quite mischievous. Iâ€™m so glad I went! The monkeys were so entertaining and the setting was beautiful! Make sure you walk through the entire park, not just the front half. I definitely recommend this activity!"
North America,"As soon as you pay and enter the park you canâ€™t help it to point your camera in all different directions, the park is lushly with matured threes and very shaded ( great for hot sunny day) and there are no shortest of monkeys playing and care for each other ( nature as it best )
Donâ€™t bring any food with you or ware any long earrings and you will be fine
Great place to â€œtake a hike â€œ"
North America,They are very quick to steal things from you and quick to run away. Make sure you have your valuables sealed. The grounds are very nice with many picturesque areas.
North America,It's definitely worth visiting once when in Ubud. There are lots of monkeys and overall the forest is just amazing. I would definitely recommend visiting here.
North America,"Very shady, therefore not so hot. Monkeys are fun, just donâ€™t steal their rocks! Nice easy walk & not too much walking. Close to Ubud shopping also."
North America,"it is little over-rated
i spent a quick 1 hour and they are little crazy monkeys aha
be careful as most tourists are ignorant and let the monkey to touch them

avoid contact and avoid taking loose bags or bags .
if you have kids make sure you dont let them near the monkeys.
they are adorable but vicious."
North America,"Very authentic place with a lot of Hindu monuments and tons of monkeys. Be aware on the rules with the monkey,s they will steal ur food or shiny valuables... :)"
North America,"We rented a car and drove to the monkey temple. We could have easily taken a tour or bus, but if youâ€™re comfortable with driving in heavy traffic and small roads, itâ€™s very convenient. It was a really cool experience and worth dedicating a few hours to. Be very careful with cameras, little kids and food!!!! These monkeys will go in your pockets and will grab anything thatâ€™s accessible to them (things hanging from your back pack etc). Overall, a fun few hours to spend walking around and seeing the temple."
North America,"My husband and I went here during our honeymoon. It was a fun experience that only took a few hours. They did have some shops inside, which afterwards, we realized were more expensive than other city shops after we left. We were warned, rightly, to not carry water bottles or wear anything shiny. We did see some people playing tug-of-war with monkeys for their plastic water bottles. The monkeys were fun for the most part, not harmful with people as far as we saw. We did catch a few monkeys fighting amongst each other (kind of scary)."
North America,"The used to sell bananas and you would hold them and the monkeys would jump on your shoulders, grab a banana, and sit on your shoulder and eat it. That was fun but probably too dangerous for the general public. Itâ€™s still fun to see them and the setting is a lot like the scenes in King Kong where Kong is fighting T-Rex in a ravine. Itâ€™s not at all expensive and an unforgettable experience."
North America,"The Monkey Forest is on almost everybodyâ€™s tourist list in Ubud. I also went to see the entertaining monkeys. I did not even get into the forest before I observed an unsuspecting tourist with a bag of Mangosteens. It was quite a spectacle when a large monkey attacked and got hold of the bags. The fruit rolled all over the sidewalk and many monkeys in the area got hold of a fruit and retreated into a rooftop or tree.
The Monkey Forest is worth a visit. It is a nice hike through the forest and the monkeys are always amusing. I recommend a visit, especially if you have children. But be aware of your belongings especially food, glasses or anything shiny."
North America,"Fun place to take the kids because they get to see monkeys in their natural habitat. The monkeys are well fed so they're less aggressive, but we found out today that they like plastic. Phones don't seem to get their attention, but when my wife took out a bag of wet wipes, the monkeys jumped on her and immediately. Naturally, she threw it on the ground and I picked it up. The monkeys then started climbing on me trying to get the bag. I quickly stuffed it my pocket and they stopped."
North America,"If you're in Ubud, the monkey forest is a must-see, even if you're a bit scared of them like me. It was a bit nerve-racking to be in an element where monkeys have run of the land. That is what also makes the experience so unique. There are also temples in the sanctuary as well. One word of advice would be to follow the rules they have. They are there for a reason to keep you safe. I felt mostly safe, except for my own fears, and I followed the rules.

It's really amazing these monkeys have a place they can roam free and call home, and we luckily get a chance to take a glimpse into it."
North America,"This place is extremely a must stop! The Monkeys are so cool and they are so many of them. They are very well behaved, as long as you dont have a water bottle or a backpack on."
North America,"This place was great, monkeys are running around everywhere, they can touch you but you cant touch them. One actually climbed up on my wife and sat on her shoulders, she had her hair in a bun and it was curious as to what that was!

Go early! earlier the better, crowds don't show up until around 10 i think we got there at 8, lots of people there to just get their Instagram picture so if your going to actually appreciate the nature, monkeys and art, go early, tickets cost 80,000RP each (6.00USD). We didn't have a guide, and didn't really feel like we missed out on anything. To us it looked like the guide was just someone you paid to take pictures of you, but maybe they had some cool facts we missed out on.

In the forest there are many beautiful Hindu temples. You are only allowed in if you are in traditional Balinese dress, this is probably done to keep the tourism out of the holy areas.

definitely recommend this to someone in the area!"
North America,"It isn't really a forest. I was expecting it to be a little less structured and more rural feeling but that didn't stop us from having a great time.

It is a beautiful place. But what isn't beautiful in Bali? Upon entering after paying there are walkways that guide you around the forest. It takes you from the outer edge into the middle. There are monkeys everywhere! They seem very tame but I witnessed many leap towards people in anger and snap at others. These monkeys come and go as they please in the park. They aren't like zoo animals kept inside so you are dealing with wild animals here. I am sure that is a given but seeing how some people were interacting with them I felt that needed to be said. The staff doesn't let you try to touch them or hold them for obvious reasons. Still, there were some people who did and most of them handled it nicely and didn't get bit.

The grounds are nicely kept and there is staff around at all times. The monkeys have no shame and WILL steal your belongings. It happened to my friend. What are you going to do though?

It is a must see for sure as it is nothing like I have ever seen."
North America,Cost was 80k IDR ($6 USD) to get in. See and interact with hundreds of monkeys in a gorgeous environment. Once in a lifetime so if you are in Bali you must make a daytrip out of it.
North America,"Don't go for the monkeys or, if we do, beware. These are not the monkeys of cartoons and fairy tales, they are real monkeys. They are adorable, yes. And they are living primates like us and prone to all of the same emotions and actions. They are aggressive when provoked and will steal things right off of your body if you let them get too close. Enough said.

Beyond that, it is home to ancient architecture, a temple, cemetery and more. It is rich in history. Enjoy"
North America,"A nature reserve and temple complex that is the home of wild tailed macaques. Dont bring food and dont wear and valuable, it's best to put them inside your bag or back pack. Lots of photo opportunities with the exotic animals.

"
North America,"Many monkeys roam both inside & outside of the park. You need to follow the visiting ""guidelines"" posted at the entrance. I've seen one opening a backpack zipper while the owner was looking the other way. 2 hours at the park was more than enough for us. And they seem to be calmer in the late afternoon."
North America,It's not that big (or small) with tons of monkeys everywhere. Just dont bring in any food that the monkeys can take/steal.
North America,"This place is awesome-- it's not often you get to be this up close and personal with nature. We had a blast here watching the monkeys. There are SO many.

Personal warning, because we saw this happen to several people around us: do NOT bring food in with you. If you think it's going to be cute to sneak some food to some cute little monkeys, I promise it isn't going to be. The girl ahead of us tried to do this, and got followed by a few (because monkeys are wildly intelligent). One jumped on her back, and started pulling everything out of her tote-- to get to the entire loaf of bread she brought in. When the others heard/saw the commotion, they all came running over to join in. She had about 20-30 little guys swarming her and jumping all over here. And while she didn't get hurt, she was pretty spooked. They can get into zippers too-- so just don't do this period. Another gal with her had a monkey open the zippers on her bag and started to pull everything out to get to the food they knew was in there. And If they see you with a plastic water bottle.... they know what this is. And will try to take it. And will succeed. I'd suggest coming in with no food, concealed water if you have it, and a bag that can close completely.

Read the signs and listen to them-- they are there for a reason. If you do that, you will have a fantastic time here."
North America,"If you don't want the monkeys to climb onto you, do not bring a a backpack or purse. The monkeys know that's where the good stuff is at. Each one of us had a monkey climb onto our back and/or pack. If they climb on, stay calm. If they start biting the strap or getting a little too close for your comfort, take off your pack and maybe just step on the strap so they can't run off with it. I saw numerous monkeys hiss and show their teeth, so please be careful. A bite and you are off to the hospital."
North America,"The grounds are lovely and it feels a bit like Disneyland with all the statues, however with over 1,000 monkeys it was quite fun! I loved watching all the monkey interactions and the occasional naughty monkey that would jump on a tourist. Rest assured there are staff on hand to help out if it happens to you."
North America,"Enter at your own risk. Monkeys are cute, but just like humans there's a mixture of nice ones and mean ones.

A monkey jumped on a lady's head and started vigorously pulling her hair checking for bugs and such. The staff is normally around but at that moment, no staff member saw and all she could do was start walking away terrified until the monkey finally leaped off.

I also stumbled upon a monkey family and they were quite peaceful and fun to watch.

If you just want to go to look at the monkeys I advice not to sit down anywhere or have your back turned to a monkey, or else they will jump on you especially if you have a backpack on.
"
North America,Very organized and clean. We have been here many times and this year the staff and establishment were excellent. The Monkeys also look healthy and happy. ðŸ˜„
North America,I love this place! Amazing!! This is a place that should never be missed. I loved the monkeys. You walk in to their sanctuary and monkeys are everywhere. I had such a wonderful time.
North America,This was so cool. I came with Hire Bali Driver Tour. The monkeys were nice and playing with each other. Definitely with a visit. Their home is so green and lush!
North America,"Once you've been there for about 15 minutes, you've seen all there is to see...but it's a lovely forest full of countless monkeys. DON'T tease them w/bananas or they WILL bite you- just give them the bloody thing! 50K entrance fee. All park/temple entrance fees have recently gone up in Bali (was just 20K like 3 years ago!). I love the hidden little bridges and such throughout this locale, and especially love seeing the baby monkeys. I'd say it's a must do if it's your first visit to Ubud."
North America,"Loved this place. Be very careful with your stuff though. A monkey climbed up my back, unzipped my backpack, and stole my passport! Luckily another tourist got it back for me. Despite that, I loved the place and all the monkeys. It's a must do in Ubud. They even have a free shuttle!"
North America,I went with my friends and it is a wild monkey experience. They are all over everything and each other. Do not walk around with food or drinks they will steal it from you by any means necessary. There are rangers walking around but they are still wild animals that are unbelievably smart.
North America,"It was about 80,000IDR, which is $5USD. Cheap adventure to see a ton of monkeys. You have to be very careful though because they will steal from you and try to bite you! I had one on my shoulder and not only did he try to take off my top, but he was trying to bite me a little. It wasn't hard and it didn't puncture my skin. He was such warning me and the people around because it was a large crowd. Really sad to be honest, because he was afraid. Just be very cautious of your friends/family and your valuables. They know how to get into backpacks too."
North America,"A must see in Ubud. Monkeys everywhere in a beautiful forest setting. Bathrooms, souvenirs, all the stuff youâ€™d expect from a popular tourist site."
North America,"I loved every minute! The monkeys are so funny; the sculptures, the temple... It's absolutely wonderful"
North America,"The sanctuary is really pretty and there are monkeys running around everywhere. It was cool to see and experience, the only bummer is it is very touristy, so expect to be around a lot of other people."
North America,Monkeys everywhere and very tolerant of the visitors. The temples are delightful. This is a fun few hours.
North America,Large forest with hundreds of monkeys. Nice to visit! They didnâ€™t come close to me which was perfect because Iâ€™m a bit afraid of them. Spare 1 hour and it should be enough.
North America,"Great place for photo op's. The monkey's are extra cute and may climb all over you. Just make sure not to have anything of value they can take, otherwise it is gone forever. They know how to open backpack zippers."
North America,"The Monkey forest was so awesome! There were so many monkeys, lots of mamas with their baby monkeys clinging onto them as they jumped from tree to tree!
Hold onto your belongings because the monkeys are pretty intelligent and are even able to UNZIP backpacks! They took my friends clothes out of his backpack & ran up a tree! One of the guards climbed up the tree after the monkey & was able to get his belongings back. Another one stole a little girls hat off of her head! They can be quite mischievous! The forest is very beautiful and well kept up. Very enjoyable!"
North America,"This is a fun place to visit just outside of Ubud. Horrible traffic in the area, but well worth a short and inexpensive walk around the forest. We thought this was a zoo, but the monkeys have free access to the surrounding jungle. The people here feed the monkeys and maintain all of the trails. You can see the monkeys doing all of their daily activities...playing, grooming, sleeping, eating, playing, and even having sex. They are pretty funny little creatures, quite amusing to us and the kids. Definitely worth an hour or so."
North America,"Real tourist trap. Perhaps it's okay for kids, but this is just one step above seeing monkeys in a zoo.

A real tourist trap!"
North America,Great place to check out. A lot of monkeys around. Trying to steal food in the bag pack hehe. The place itself is nice forest looking like and the temples are nice. Nice to walk around and enjoy the day with the lovely monkeys :). Must see in Ubud. The kids and adult will have fun.
North America,"Such entertainment! I got there 2 hours before they closed and wished I would've gone earlier. Even thought about going a 2nd day but was limited on days/time during vacation. Otherwise, I probably could've stayed there all day. You're not allowed to bring outside food or drinks, so the likelihood of monkeys jumping on you is not high. Monkeys are well fed by the park so they ssem harmless and not aggressive towards humans. But of course don't take for granted that they are ""wild animals"" and can be unpredictable...so it's always best to keep a little distance."
North America,"The monkeys here arenâ€™t that aggressive and wonâ€™t jump on you unless you provoke them or invite them to (especially compared to the ones at Uluwatu). For me, I had watched and studied them for several hours and wanted to get one on my head. They were very intrigued by my backpack and so I sat down next to them and sure enough, they were on it, but they couldnâ€™t figure out how to open it. They are very good with zippers though, and will get annoyed if you let them on your bag and then block their path from getting into it.
If you follow the rules and listen to the park rangers, they wonâ€™t bother you. They are so cute and fun to watch!"
North America,"Well worth the time to walk through the Monkey Forest. It is located near the Abud market, so you can easily see both in a few hours."
North America,"This was a pleasant park to walk around. There are close to a 1,000 monkeys living in the forest. There are posted rules about being around the monkeys that should be followed. Caretakers are stationed throughout the Sanctuary to watch the monkeys and visitors. They are the only ones to feed the animals and there is plenty of that happening. Do beware of monkeys jumping on you and only take the very minimal in the park that you need. I saw monkeys jumping on people to take water bottles that you are not supposed to have and on bags. They are fearless. But do enjoy watching them and walking the park as it a good place to visit. Maybe allow 1 to 2 hours."
North America,Gorgeous grounds and precious monkeys. Go early so you too can avoid the crowds. The monkeys are playful and interesting.
North America,As the day came to visit the monkey forest wasn't sure what to expect but definitely was a great experience!! Once there you will be greeted by a huge monkey statue and as you walk into the sanctuary be ready to encounter lots and lots of monkeys. They roam freely and were as curious as expected so keep your personal belongings in a purse or backpack.
North America,If you bring any food at all anywhere in any of your bags or pockets they will smell it. If you dont you will have no issues at all. Its that simple. My girlfriend and I were here for 3 hours and saw and enjoyed all it had to offer without any issues. I would love to come back.
North America,"Like a lot of other reviewers, beware of these semi-cute primates. It's a little unnerving that at the entrance of the park, there's a prominently featured first aid clinic. The gardens are nice and the entrance fee is reasonable, but I regret having gone. You can see the monkeys in the areas outside of the park and there's only one species to see (from the best that I can tell). An added minus: It's packed with people. Go when it opens at 8:30am. But probably not worth the effort unless you have little ones that won't mind getting their hand chomped by a monkey"
North America,"You had me at monkey! This was my favorite thing we did in Bali! The monkeyâ€™s were a laugh riot to watch. For the most part they could careless that youâ€™re there. So you can get right next to them for amazing pix. Theyâ€™d go flying past you chasing each other. One monkey grabbed my skirt. I felt like he was my buddy. It was a stunningly beautiful park. We kept saying that we were in a Indiana Jones movie. Pretty special day weâ€™ll never forget. We hired a guide to take us around the island Panca at Bali Customized Tours if you need a guide. This stop was definitely my absolute fav!! â€œThereâ€™s a lot of monkeying aroundâ€
â€œA lot of monkey businessâ€ Okay, I promise Iâ€™ll stop. Lol"
North America,We visited the monkey forest and we really enjoyed seeing how well taking cares of the monkeys were. There were fed in several places and there were not as aggressive as I had anticipated. I was glad I visited the park.
North America,"We arrived to the monkey forest at 3 pm and found that it was not overly crowded. We still had plenty of time to observe/interact with the monkeys. There are several feeding areas across the park and meal time is really fun to watch.

My significant other brought a backpack (might be wise to leave it at home if you are not ready for monkeys to be jumping on you constantly) and had quite a few â€œvisitorsâ€ jump on him and attempt to get the contents of the backpack out. Heâ€™d simply move the backpack to his front and the monkeys would scatter. They also loved the pockets (Velcro) on his shorts and attempted to get into his pockets several times.

If a monkey jumps on you, please do not panic. Start walking and they will run off.
Itâ€™s important to note there are numerous staff members all over the park that will help you if they see thereâ€™s a monkey on you/ or that you are uncomfortable - they have slings that they point at the monkeys (though we have never seen a staff member actually use one!). It appears that the monkeys are genuinely cared for and loved.

Weâ€™d definitely return to the monkey forest."
North America,"Went here for about 45 minutes during a full day tour of Ubud with our guide. Itâ€™s a really beautiful park and itâ€™s cool to see all the monkeys roaming around. Definitely worth a stop by while youâ€™re in Ubud but there isnâ€™t a need to spend a lot of time there. I thought this was going to be a forest with places to hike around etc, but itâ€™s more of a causal walk to look at some monkeys.

Really cool but set expectations to be ready to leave in about an hour. or less."
North America,"We spent two to three hours walking in every nook and cranny of the Sacred monkey forest. The statues and the carvings were interesting, but to observe the monkeys in their (semi-)natural surroundings was the best. It is good to observe all the warnings they have posted there -- like ""don't try to take your water bottle from a monkey that has snatched from you""!"
North America,"Visiting the Sacred Monkey Forest was so much fun! These monkeys are very entertaining to watch! One of them even took a ride on my shoulder haha! If you love animals or even if you donâ€™t, this is a must do! Just donâ€™t have any food or things that look like food on you!"
North America,"Great to see that humans and animals can coexist and enjoy each other's company. Of course, there are people that bring food in their backpacks and feed them as well as getting them to come on their shoulders etc. One got scratched which had to be taken to a clinic for treatment. I was just amazed at how they go about doing their things and constantly on the move. It is a very unique experience to be that close to them"
North America,And have opposable thumbs so they weirdly look like humans...or apes. They are cheeky! Wish the crowds werenâ€™t so pervasive.
North America,"Adult ticket was IDR 89,000 - about USD 6. The area was maintained clean and there weren't many monkey by the entrance but there were many more inside. There were many workers who kept those monkeys well fed and managed to keep them from being wild. Unless, visitors provoke them by teasing them of offering food. Nice place to visit for at least once."
North America,"Thereâ€™s a lot of mixed reviews out there, but thought Iâ€™d address a few points:

1. Danger - While these are wild animals, the only people I saw who had any issues were actively invading their (the monkeys) pace, following them around and sticking cameras in their faces. This included allowing their children free reign. Weird that these people had problems!

2. Slingshots - I only saw these used twice. The first was across the street with a monkey that had stolen from a gift shop and was throwing the gifts down at everyone from the trees. The other was a shopkeeper keeping a monkey out of her store. No one seemed to be trying to keep the monkeys in. Pretty sure all the free food does that.

3. Bag check. At entrance 1, as part of the large circular desk there is a station labeled luggage. It was listed as closed but my assumption is that if you asked any of the other stations they could accommodate. This is great if you have things youâ€™re concerned about being stolen and donâ€™t have a car.

We had a great time, got some fun pictures.

Four stars for the crowds (the size and the quality of the people) otherwise would have been a 5."
North America,Well preserved sanctuary. We stayed for longer than three hours just to enjoy the beautiful serene surroundings. The monkeys were fell fed so they looked healthy. There were many workers to ensure safety for visitors and for the monkeys. The park was large enough that it didnâ€™t feel overly crowded with tourists. Definitely worth the money and the trip to visit this beautiful sanctuary.
North America,"Wonderful day trip for the family. Just make sure if you have backpack and the monkeys jump on it, KEEP WALKING! That was not on the instructions of what to do/not to do sign. As you keep walking, the monkeys loose balance and would jump off from your backpack. If you stand still, they will start opening your the zipper and going through your things. I learned really quick after a few of them jumped on mine. The place is beautiful, and I think they have something around 800+ monkeys, semi-wild."
North America,A small forest with lots of monkeys. Good place to see how monkeys live together. Be careful with your belongings since monkeys like to steal your stuffs. There will be people that escort you around to keep monkeys away but at the end they want you to come to their shops and buy things but you donâ€™t have to buy it if you donâ€™t want.
North America,"Monkey forest is amazing, but so many people don't follow the rules. It's amazing that more people don't get bit. Don't make extended eye contact with the monkeys, don't bring food in, don't feed the monkeys, don't touch the monkeys. It isn't that hard. They are aggressive wild animals.

Tip: Our tour guide (from a different excursion) told us that it's safer to go in the afternoon when they aren't hangry and waiting for the food to be released. In general, you should be completely safe, but watch out for other tourists that aren't following the rules and stay away from them in case they aggravate the monkeys. The monkeys are fine; the people are the problem.

Another tip: If you really want to interact with the monkeys, do it through one of the staff members looking to make some extra cash. They will do a photo op for you for like 20k (money well spent!). Don't try to get the photo on your own."
North America,"I had been to this Forest Sanctuary 10 years ago and then 20 years ago. I was disappointed to find that it had been turned into a giant tourist attraction. The monkeys look unwell as they are being fed by people and by the guards that wander the property.

Im concerned that these monkeys are getting sick as their hair was falling off. Walking around the property was clean and the plants were attractive but I miss the days when you could just walk about and see the monkeys in a natural environment. The greed to make more money was very off putting."
North America,"We visited the sanctuary on our day trip to Ubud. It was very enjoyable. The monkeys generally have no fear of humans, so you will see them up close and personal. They arenâ€™t aggressive, so you have nothing to fear from them as long as you donâ€™t get aggressive with them.

We still arenâ€™t clear about the policy on feeding them. Nothing really is stated at the entry, at least as far as we could tell. It would be nice to be able to feed them, but I can understand the desire to avoid some miscreants feeding them poisoned food. Perhaps the solution is to allow feeding, but only with food purchased at the site.

If you are staying in Ubud or making a day trip there, donâ€™t miss it."
North America,"This place is definitely worth a stop, and the monkeys are pretty dang cute. But beware, people are bitten here every day. Do not bring anything with you, they will go through it. I had a small bag, that only contained my sunglasses and medicated blistex chapstick. I wish I knew that animals would like chapstick, because a monkey sat on my lap, peed on me, then ran away with my bag. After this all occurred, another monkey came out of nowhere and bit me on the hip. It was day three of our honeymoon and this caused me a lot of anxiety on what to do afterwards. Just be wary...."
North America,"This is a great place to see lots of monkeys. If you are smart and paying attention, the monkeys probably won't bother you. Just take off your sunglasses and don't let them have access to your backpack or purse. If you sit anything down, they will try to get in it. We saw a few people have issues, but those who didn't have anything to tempt them were fine. It looks like these monkeys were very well fed, so they were less bothersome than other monkeys we saw in Bali."
North America,"This is a must do when in the area. The monkeys were so funny. One would lay still while another one groomed it. I guess they were picking off fleas and then they ate them!! One monkey mum had twins and she was so busy keeping track of them.
They are smart, beautiful animals."
North America,Worthwhile to visit with soany monkeys in their natural habitat - even if a little too people friendly . Good to take kids 5 and above
North America,"I was a bit concerned about going since a lot of reviews made the monkeys seem aggressive. Thankfully, this was not the case. They were all so entertaining! It was an awesome mix of rambunctiousness, mischievousness and some minor pocket picking! I did have one jump up onto my backpack but I ignored him a d kept on going. He jumped off, and thanks to a road blocking the very narrow bridge (people blocking the path so they could get a selfie with another monkey on the bridge railing and small children running around) his curiosity got the best of him and he grabbed onto the pack again and fumbled with the zippers before grabbing onto it and trying to bite it open. The Forrest is huge and there are plenty of opportunities to see the monkeys as well as the temple and other shrines as well as walk around in nature. I would not only recommend this, I may go back before I return to the states!!"
North America,"The Sacred monkey forest is located in Ubud, Bali. Since it was at the end of our road, and the end of our stay in Ubud, we decided it was too close to miss out on...so we set out on a hike. When we arrived, we paid the 80,000 IDR ($5.65 USD) to get in and explore around.
This rain forest is home to over 800 macaque monkeys, a sanctuary. You will see some out roaming around the streets, but the forest is their main home. It was interesting to say the least, yet a bit unnerving as these primates ran around, fought and ate in the morning sun.
Some things to consider:
-leave anything of value in your room, they WILL steal sunglasses, earrings, wallets, etc.. I had a death grip on my phone, so they never attempted it.
Another tip is to go in the morning after feeding time, they seem much more relaxed and subdued after their feast.
Do go though, it is an amazing place that should not be missed."
North America,They have little monkeys running around eating food. Not much else to see and the monkeys aren't that interesting or cute.
North America,"What a beautiful park, filled with hilarious and curious monkeys. We made sure and followed the park rules and didnâ€™t try to â€œmess withâ€ the monkeys. They still jumped on my husbands backpack and tried to open it- theyâ€™re very curious. Go, enjoy the beautiful park and hilarious monkeys, but leave what you can at the hotel. We explored for about 3 hours and wished we had more time!"
North America,"Absolutely awesome to visit. Lots of monkeys however you must remember theyâ€™re animals. Be cautious. Also one hopped on me and ate the flowers in my hair and then stole a girlâ€™s water bottle. One also tried to open my backpack. Long story short, watch your stuff. Each monkey has a different personality. One sat next to me and I pet him and a different one growled at me for food. Workers stand around and make sure they donâ€™t do monkey business but thereâ€™s a few isolated areas. Itâ€™s lots of fun but probably not for little children. They really donâ€™t mind pictures, even flash pictures I got some great close ups"
North America,"I was underwhelmed by the Monkey Forest. Though unusual to have wild monkeys scampering around like pigeons, I found this place overrun with tourists engaging unnaturally with the monkeys (who were clearly used to the barrage of human visitors & werenâ€™t exactly behaving as wild monkeys would) I walked in and after about 15 minutes was ready to turn around and walk out."
North America,"There really are monkeys everywhere! As long as youâ€™re prepared - no sunglasses, dangly jewelry, water bottles or food in your bags - then you can easily walk around the park and observe the monkeys for hours. My favorite part was seeing the staff interact with the monkeys. They would clap near them, or throw them nuts. It was clean, well-marked, and clearly a very popular tourist destination. Itâ€™s definitely worth a visit if youâ€™re in Ubud. We entered at Gate 2, which wasnâ€™t nearly as crowded. Enjoy!"
North America,"It definitely is a must if you go to Ubud, but we had such a hard time there with the monkeys around. They were so agressive and scary. They tried to attack me once and my friend was attacked twice, so soon enough we realised we were not really having what we would call a good time in there. Only a bottle of water was stolen but we heard so many cases of monkeys stealing your stuff that we decided to just put everything in our bags. We saw a boy get bitten on his shoulder, so I wouldn't recommend it for kids."
North America,"Intimate way to encounter docile monkeys in a large habitat. They are well fed and seemingly well cared for. Babies are adorable. Hike to the temple by the waterfalls.
"
North America,"It is a well thought out, planned and built sanctuary. Good for Tourists, will well built pathways, monkeys free to roam around, not it cages. There is a Balinese temple and cremation house within the sanctuary. The parking is ample for a fee. You pay a fee to enter the forest, which is not that cheap either. There are a lot of maps to indicate your position within the forest. You enter the forest from three points/entrances. The visitors are prohibited from feeding the monkeys. There are plenty of opportunities to watch the monkeys being fed. I came here after a tour of Ubud rice fields."
North America,"This was first on our list of casual stops in Ubud and we had such a good time! We arrived around noon and quickly got tickets at the counter ($80,000). The main entrance has beautiful fountains and a large modern structure that I wasn't expecting from the pictures I had seen.

There were helpful maps around the park that helped us to navigate. Immediately we saw tons of monkeys. They seem to be thriving and there were many feeding stations around the park with docents interacting with the monkeys and keeping both monkeys and visitors safe.

I had read that you could buy bananas to give the monkeys but did not see that at all. The people working there as well as the signs actively told you not to feed the animals at all. You really don't need to in any case because they still jumped on my husband even with no food offered! They were interested in our backpack and started unzipping it.

In addition to monkeys the park has many temples and beautiful sculptures. We spent 3 hours walking around and saw everything.

I highly recommend this as a stop on your vacation!"
North America,"Four stars for the resident macaques,
minus one for crowds. The monkeys are fun to watch but be careful. They know plastic bags might have food. However, they are clearly the smarter of the two main primates in the area. Watch out for jumpy tourists and oblivious selfie snappers and you can have a peaceful visit. Price is now 80000 rupiah."
North America,"A cool place to visit and stroll through. Be sure to remove your glasses, zip your purses and backpacks up. The monkeys are very curious. Pay attention to the signs and do not taunt the monkeys."
North America,The forest is a short walk from the center of Ubud. You are greeted by monkeys as soon as you enter the gates. There are some temples and paved walking areas around the grounds. There were monkeys at every turn. There are also guides to keep the monkeys in line or help you with photo ops.
North America,"it's fantastic to walk through this beautiful forest, which is the monkeys' natural habitat. It's fun to watch them playing, grooming each other, and I even got a close up of a baby nursing on his mamma. Word of caution: watch your things b//c the monkeys are bold! One jumped on my back and helped himself to the hand sanitizer and bug spray that were in the side pocket of my backpack!"
North America,"Lol the monkeys all have funny personalities! While we were there, a monkey went inside of a visitors backpack and took out his air pods! He then decided to climb the trees and literally taunt him and one of the staff members! Everyone started to gather around while the monkey was above above us! The staff began to offer food to make him return the pods but he came down grabbed the food and went back up lol! He came down for more food and ate the food with one hand and the AirPods in the other. He knew he had everyoneâ€™s attention and decided to put it down right in front of him but no one wanted to approach. He quickly picked them back up and put them down again! He fed him food and scared him, leaving the AirPods behind we were able to retrieve it! Lol whatâ€™s funny is I was the one to capture it all on camera lol Iâ€™ll see if I can turn them into photos lol oh yes! And donâ€™t forget to find a monkey and get a selfie!!"
North America,"Don't just go there for the monkeys, go there to admire the nature of this place and the splendid beauty of the area. I would recommend not going with lose objects and valuables. The area has a designated parking location which you pay for, but it is really cheap."
North America,"After coming to Bali and Ubud for 8 years we never fail to stop and go see the monkeys at least once. This year and last year they stopped selling bananas to feed the monkeys and I was sorry to see that. To me the monkeys have become more aggressive. I am wondering if it's because they don't have the bannas. Of course I am sure there were other problems when people were feeding the monkeys but it is a great place to experience them in their own invirement. By all means go if in Ubud and don't forget to visit the little shops on the backside of the temple, they always seem to have some good buys."
North America,"We enjoyed our walk through the Monkey Forest - it was fun to see all the monkeys and especially the babies.

Please just remember that these are wild animals, so they are not to be teased and care should be taken around them. We only saw one 'incident' where a child had worn a sparkly t-shirt and a monkey became interested. Everyone thought it was 'cute' until he tried to bite off one of the sequins.....not an aggressive bite, but in inquisitive one. I don't think the monkey should be condemned for that action (something to remember if you plan on a visit)."
North America,"We visited the forest in the morning and it was great trip, monkeys were lovey and friendly and people gave them food. The atmosphere was relaxing and the sights were spectacular."
North America,Amazing trek! You are up close with the monkeys! Remember not to look them straight in too their eyes!
North America,"I loved this place, it was much more beautiful than I anticipated, and were were a lot of money's. I would go again, you'd ever expect from the outside it's so big. I love just watching them with their babies and just enjoying life. It was a cool experience."
North America,"Visiting the Monkey Sanctuary for an hour or two is a must if you find yourself in Bali. You'll walk amongst hundreds of monkeys and feel like you're in an episode of NatGeo. We were lucky enough to witness an alpha male from one of the groups defend his territory from other males during feeding time. I was also unlucky enough to have a monkey climb me and take the water bottle out of my backpack. All in good fun. Plus, it's rather inexpensive and has some cool areas amd statues. Enjoy!"
North America,"Before heading out to Bali I read some reviews about aggressive monkeys at the park. Well Iâ€™m back and like to report that these monkeys are not aggesive, they are very well feed and kept. If you use some adult common sense you should not have any issues at this place!"
North America,"We went with our 2 year old daughter. We were fearful going in of safety bc of all the valid warnings. We followed the rules, kept to ourselves and observed these amazing creatures. The views are incredible, walks are long, and monkeys were amazing to see all around us. Highly recommend, but please be careful and follow the rules!"
North America,"I was initially hesitant to visit because being jumped on by wild monkeys didn't sound like my idea of a good time.
However, this amazing forest feels worlds away from the rest of Ubud once you are inside. There is plenty to explore and it is all incredibly beautiful.
Make sure you venture through the entire forest and take your time in the more tranquil areas.
Of course, if you do like encounters with monkeys you have plenty of opportunity for that. But you can also have a wonderful day exploring the forest and easily keep a comfortable distance from the monkeys if you prefer."
North America,"I came to monkey forest 3 years ago and it was a great experience. This time it was totally different and very sad to see the changes.

They have now built up what almost looks like an amusement park entry way, with overpriced tickets, which was never there before.

They have also prevented you feeding the monkeys, so they arenâ€™t interactive with people.

We also noticed how dramatically less monkeys there were, and we later found out that they are injecting them to prevent the monkeys reproducing, which was really upsetting to hear.

They have also enclosed the area, so the few monkeys that are left donâ€™t have the freedom they once had.

I spent 15 minutes here and decided to leave.
Please donâ€™t support this business.
There are far more ethical ways to see monkeys in the wild, happy and in their natural habitat, where they arenâ€™t getting pumped with chemicals.

Itâ€™s a shame that what was once a beautiful place, has been capitalized.

"
North America,"Cute monkeys but be careful because they are well known to take tourist sunglasses phone and wallets
In my experience saw another tourist got his sunglasses taken by a naughty monkey. Thankfully there was the zookeper who convinced the monkey to give back his sunglasses"
North America,"Great place and a must in Ubud..... please go and treat with respect, dont feed them and let them be, they very cute and friendly"
North America,"Third visit. Love what theyve done w/ place. Monkeys stayed well clear of people (husband happy). Loved the feeding by attendants... Also art exhibit!
This is Bali MUST SEE!!!"
North America,"I will say that I had mixed feelings about visiting the monkey for us before we got there. Iâ€™m not sure exactly what I expected, however I do know that I was ready to leave much faster than I expected to be. The older monkeys are very aggressive as the younger monkeys tend to be more curious. Please do yourself a favor and leave anything of personal value in your car or elsewhere as the monkeys will â€œattackâ€. We saw lots of people wearing backpacks who were then ambushed by monkeys jumping on their backâ€˜s to see what they had inside of their backpacks. Also the monkeys are literally everywhere so if you scare easily this may not be an attraction for you."
North America,This is a pretty cool touristy thing to do. The monkeys wander all over the place and they are really cute. You get really pictures and videos of the monkeys doing silly things. The forest itself is beautiful and it's worth a walk through. I wouldn't say it's a must do though.
North America,"Beautiful place with the cutest monkeys ever! Do not carry food in your bags. Monkeys are everywhere, if you sit down they will just come to you."
North America,"Amazing forrest full of monkeys, as the name suggests. It's like $6 US to get in and the pictures you can get are worth that fee alone! Monkeys are pretty friendly and crawl on you if you're patient and take a seat."
North America,We were at the entrance and ready to go in when our guide mentioned that he had been bitten twice previously by monkeys in the park. We decided to skip the experience but were able to see many free roaming monkeys simply driving around the outside of the park.
North America,"Monkeys climb on people, take sunglasses, open bags, grab water bottles--and yes! one of our friends was bit! (It was kind of her fault because she sat down right in the path of a big male monkeys and he got angry.) The First Aid station said not to worry, no rabbles have been reported, but upon further investigation (with the hotel doctor) rabbles are quite possible. I wouldn't let the possibility of being bit deter you from going, I'd just be careful not to aggravate them. That said--it was as if we'd jumped into a banyon-tree-tomb-raider-temple movie set. The monkeys defiantly have the run of the park. A fun excursion!"
North America,"The monkeys are great, but tricky. Be careful anything you carry they take. One took an earring out of my ear ( without hurting me or breaking the earring) had a guard trade a banana with the monkey to get my earring back. The scenery in the sanctuary is mind blowing. Itâ€™s green and lush. There is a platform path you can take to walk through the fabulous vegetation"
North America,"Pay (few dollars) and walk into a forested canyon in the middle of UBUD. We took a taxi there ($28/pp for 8-hour taxi ride). We walked through the forest, viewed many monkeys but the temple is closed to only those who are dressed properly to pray."
North America,It was so neat to walk around and see the monkeys in their natural habitat. Go right when it opens in the morning so you arenâ€™t overrun with other tourists. Donâ€™t bring ANY food - the monkeys WILL attack you for it!
North America,"If you are going there to see monkeys, you are wasting your money. You can find monkeys in Uluvatu temple. I liked rain forest like environment."
North America,This place was amazing! Truly in awe of how the jungle keeps going and going ... and you can tell the keepers genuinely care for the animals. However - do NOT wear earrings! I repeat - NO earrings. I read the rules and assumed no dangly ones but when taking a selfie the monkey notices my cheap shiny earrings and ripped it right from my ear!!! I was so scared sheâ€™d swallow it but luckily spit it out before getting some corn. All in all - be mindful and youâ€™ll enjoy yourself :)
North America,They no longer do the selfies with monkeys. They just roam free around the sanctuary. I guess for $6USD it's not too bad. You have to do what you can to get pics with them on your own.
North America,"It's a MUST on the list of life. I had no idea I would fall victim to monkeys jumping on my back, It was a bit freaky ~ remain calm if possible which was tough for me. They were trying to get into my backpack which was funny to everyone around me ;-) It's a beautiful space and the monkeys are so fun to watch!"
North America,Had a blast here! It's really amazing seeing the monkeys forest. One even stole a napkin from me...ðŸ˜‚ Looking forward to coming back again!
North America,757 monkeys (never more than 760 we were told). Delightful stroll through a well maintained park. Don't stare the monkeys directly in the eyes. It distresses them and they can behave badly.
North America,"Great place to wonder around for a couple hours, beautiful scenery and no shortage of monkeys.
Be careful of sunglasses going missing!"
North America,The monkeys are so cute and sociable. They actually pose for the camera. Make sure to follow the guidelines and youâ€™ll be fine. We had a wonderful time at the forest.
North America,"My husband and I enjoyed wandering around the monkey forest and seeing all the monkeys. Itâ€™s neat to have such a sanctuary in the middle of Ubud.

Wish visitors would be more respectful of the monkeys. We saw many people antagonizing and trying to engage them when there are signs all over the place saying to leave the monkeys alone and let them be."
North America,Great setup and all the staff was amazing!! ðŸ¥° clean and well taken care of! Affordable and we could have spent hours there! Close to the main roads as well and restaurants / shopping :)
North America,"This is a very nice park to walk through even without the monkeys. Nice paths and large trees make for shade and nature walk. There are several signs posting the general rules of the park regarding the monkeys. Even in the bathroom stall it asks not to touch or interact with them. YET you see irresponsible tourists feeding them, touching them, and sitting down so theyâ€™ll jump on their shoulders. The park rangers do a great job watching everything. They saw that one monkey grabbed a pack of cigarettes off a tourist and he was able to get it back so the monkeys would eat it and get sick. The rangers have sling shots to help co trip issues so all you people who cry about animal rights stop giving them things or acting inappropriate and they wonâ€™t be hit with a sling shot."
North America,Very interesting in a beautiful setting. Our tour guide made certain we visited early in the morning to avoid crowds and when monkey's were more mellow.
North America,"Beautiful setting, lots of photo ops, beautiful temple and monkeys everywhere. It is a must see if you go to Ubud. So much fun."
North America,"This was a really fun thing to do while in Ubud! The grounds are so beautiful with a giant banyan tree over the river. The park is so large, tou could spend hours walking around. The monkeys are cute and very entertaining to watch. Just be sure to leave your snacks in the car otherwise they will snatch them from you! It was a great experience!"
North America,"The monkeys can get quite aggressive. A lot of tourists think its cute but monkeys can be dangerous animals. I hadn't realised that my bag had an empty plastic bag inside but they jumped on me, went crazy rummaging through my bag, and stole my sunscreen and mosquito repellent. not amused -_-"
North America,"We didn't give ourselves enough time to walk through and see all the attractions, but we managed to rush through it anyway. It was a little unnerving at first, because the monkeys are just laying on the walkway, running around, and swinging from trees right over you. BUT- that's why we went! We didn't have any problems with the monkeys jumping on us, but one person in our group did have a monkey grab the bottom of her dress and it wouldn't let go. When we tried to pull her away, the monkey hissed. No harm, it was kinda funny. But the monkey is super cool, fun, and a great time. There's so much to see, be sure to give yourself a couple of hours!"
North America,This is a must-do in Ubud. There are lots of monkeys who are well fed and mostly socialized but they are still wild animals and it is not a zoo so keep your belongings close and don't pet them. Lots of babies and the monkeys seem to be happy and well cared for by the staff. Great for families. My son is 9 and loved it.
North America,"The forest is fun, but signs say not to make eye contact with the monkeys so they don't feel threatened. It kind of freaked me out. Monkeys are everywhere and the forest is amazing."
North America,"This place made me beyond happy without a trace of guilt. It was amazing to see these beautiful creatures live and up close and NOT behind bars. Theyâ€™re very cheeky and playful. The monkey Forrest itself is absolutely gorgeous - paradise for nature enthusiasts. I highly suggest this place for anyone - as you canâ€™t help but feel like a kid again with excitement, laughter and curiosity."
North America,"It was overall a great experience, and we saw an innumerable amount of monkeys. The grounds are well maintained, and the setting itself is gorgeous. We went in the middle of the afternoon around 3:00PM, and didnâ€™t experience any pesky mosquitos. However, we did prepare by wearing mosquito bracelets and spray with feet just in case.

Those wanting to visit should follow the rules and understand the following:
1. Do not feed the monkeys
2. Do not bring anything with you into the park except for a camera/phone
3. Do not try to touch a monkey
4. Do not look the monkeys directly in the eye
5. Do not get too close to monkeys playing with one another or mother/baby monkeys.

I saw several tourists trying to do all of the above, which was so disappointing. Basically, be respectful of their home! Every monkey we saw seemed happy and relaxed. I would be cautious with bringing any kids unless they are able to follow the rules above."
North America,"This is a must do in UBUD! The walk is peaceful and beautiful!

Do not bring any plastic bags or anything dangling as it says on the signs, I watched the monkeys steal from several people. They are wild animals! Just be smart!

Don't stick your camera in their face and respect that this is their home.

You can tell they train the monkeys with the slingshot. I watched a monkey climbing on a boy for a while and when the guard pulled out the slingshot and pointed it at the monkey he knew that meant he better stop so that was a little upsetting."
North America,"The sacred monkey forest is a cool place to visit on any day except rainy ones. However, the monkeys are freely roaming all over the forest and itâ€™s really cute to see them hangout and swing around the trees. It costs to park there and obviously the entry fee as well. I would recommend but itâ€™s not something you will spend all day at. It could be done and fully enjoyed within 1 hour. All in all, quite enjoyable ! Take water and make sure to not let the monkeys grab your things, they love to steal! Also, they do bite so donâ€™t provoke!"
North America,"Nature and animal lovers, you will be delighted and thrilled with the depth of beauty here. Ancient trees, temples, and of course monkeys:) Lots and lots of monkeys!
So why only two stars?? The hoards of disrespectful tourist who have very little regard for nature. People sticking their cameras an inch away from a infant monkeys face, feeding the monkeys chips and other garbage, AND a Chinese guy trying to put a baby monkey in his messenger bag. WTF . I was appalled at humanity. If you go here,do not treat these animals merely as props for your selfies AND if you see ANY animal mistreatment, its is imperative that you report it IMMEDIATELY !"
North America,"The forest was beautiful, and seeing the monkeys grooming, running, climbing, etc. was really special. However, heed the warnings regarding not bringing food into the forest. I accidentally packed a pastry in the side of my backpack (exposed), and the monkeys stole it and got very aggressive. It was my mistake, of course, but it was a tense situation. If you're careful, the park will be amazing!"
North America,"The habitat is great for the monkeys, pretty cool to see. Very easy to get to if staying near Ubud. Pretty steamy though, so be ready to sweat!"
North America,"When going to Bali one must go to the Monkey Forest. It is amazing how many monkeys there are especially out in the distance.

The monkeys are definitely aggressive so be careful with food, getting too close and any valuables you may have easily accessible. If you do that just simply walk around and enjoy.

As cool as the forest was I left a little underwhelmed. Maybe I was expecting so much more or it is always hyped up so much.

It was one of the more forgettable places for me in Bali, but still a must see."
North America,"My husband and I were walking along a boardwalk path with some steps. There was a monkey sitting on one of the steps....in the middle of the path. I had read up on all the tips, I had no jewelry, no purse, no food, nothing - and I did not even look at him. I just proceeded to walk by and he grabbed one leg and bit my ankle, I ignored him and kept walking and he grabbed my other leg and bit that ankle. I kept walking and he let go. It wasnâ€™t really that painful. I looked down and saw scratch marks...not 100% sure if his teeth left marks or his claws. It happened so fast, but I did see him bite me. And both ankles were bleeding. It was surreal. I went to the First Aid station where they assured me I was going to be fine. The young lady cleaned the wiped the wounds and put iodine on them and sent me on my way.

Later that afternoon I took a shower and really washed the wounds well. The one ankle began to bleed again and I called the front desk of our resort (Komaneka) to see if they had antibiotic cream. They didnâ€™t and highly recommended we go to the clinic. Eventually, we went to the clinic....apparently I was their 3rd monkey bit that day. $350 US later and after only 30 min, they had cleaned the wounds, given me 2 Rabies shots, antibiotic cream, antibiotic pills and pills to prevent Hepatitis - and sent me home. They do take credit cards! They were wonderful, efficient & helpful. I guess Iâ€™ll need to go get another rabies vaccine soon.

I would go to the forest again....but I wouldnâ€™t come that close to a monkey again."
North America,"Great do not touch the monkeys and act natural
And make sure you walk with nothing in you hands with them open"
North America,"We were skeptical about visiting the monkey forest because there were a lot of monkeys out in the street, and we saw a lady's bag get attacked by one! But we went back the next day and we were pleasantly surprised! The Sacred Forest in and of itself is a beautiful place to visit, and the monkeys make for a very enjoyable, and photographed walk! The only downside is that this attraction costs 80,000 IDR (about $8 CAD) which is a bit over priced for this attraction in Asia."
North America,"Iâ€™ve always loved monkeys and nature. So, this is the perfect place for me to enjoy. Not only are the monkeys fun to watch, the surroundings are simply beautiful!"
North America,"The Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary is more than that. certainly, there are many monkeys and you will be told to be careful. I didn't have any problem with the monkeys around, but one has to exercise caution and not bother the animals with a lot of photos or trying to pet them. There is a river that runs through the forest, a cemetery (get someone to explain to you the spiritual connections related to this part of the Forest), and numerous sites to enjoy a quiet moment. I was pleasantly surprised that this place was much more than a monkey forest."
North America,My friends and I loved our time at the monkey forest in Ubud. The monkeys are all over the grounds and easy to interact with. A visit to the Sacred Monkey Forest Santuary really is a must while in Ubud!
North America,An unusual place where the monkeys run free as you wander around the forested park (so watch your stuff!).
North America,"We walked to the sanctuary from Ubud Palace and it only took us 15 min. The monkeys were out and playful (but donâ€™t try to get too friendly). The sanctuary is very nice and not too large so sometimes on the path things would get crowded and everyone waited. There was some ceremonial events happening so we got to see locals in their ritual garb.

We stayed for about an hour and saw everything."
North America,"This is a must see if you are in UBud. About a 10-15 minute walk from UBud center, the grounds are well done, lots of diverse terrain and lots of room to roam. Sone great trees, places to sit and relax and watch the monkeys. Feeding time seemed to last all day. Donâ€™t bring a backpack with you, leave it at the center, monkeys will try to take your things!"
North America,"Cool experience to take some photos and video of the statues, scenery, and monkeys. However, it comes with a risk. For the most part, these monkeys won't cause any problems, but it's the people who are unpredictable. Some kid thought it would be funny to try to feed a monkey a leaf, and it got angry. Chasing the teen, and biting him in the leg. This was in a crowded area of the forest, and many people started running away. So it's really the unpredictability of not only the monkeys, but other visitors who may provoke/bother these animals, which can cause issues for EVERYONE. Something to think about before taking your children or loved ones there. A bite or scratch could ruin the rest of the trip."
North America,The monkeys are too cute. They climbed on a couple of people while we were there. We saw one steal from a woman's purse. We saw a couple having sex and a few fighting one another. It was a cute experience.
North America,"The Monkey Forest attracts a lot of tourists, but it's worth a visit. The setting is calm, shady and peaceful, which can be a welcome break from sunny Ubud's busy streets. Keep your personal items close at hand because the monkeys are not at all intimidated by people. The front desk accepts credit cards for tickets and there is an ATM onsite."
North America,"It's pretty much a must-do if you are near Ubud. It's not perfect, partly because of visitor bad behavior and partly because staff don't entirely mitigate that, but it is a marvelous monkey experience if YOU behave yourself. Please do not feed, taunt or tempt the monkeys with bags or bottles hanging from your purse or backpack. Just observe at a respectful distance and avoid confrontation. My husband and I both visited the forest and used it as a commuting path between our hotel and downtown Ubud. Each time we passed through we enjoyed some other aspect of monkey behavior, most notably an impromptu ""pool party"" in one of the fountains. Who knew that monkeys loved to play in water so much?"
North America,We spent a few hours at the monkey forest and loved it. The monkeys are very entertaining; even saw swimming monkeys while we were there. Do not bring food or drink into the park as the monkeys will go into your bag for them and it is not healthy for them to eat. We did see a girl get bit by a monkey because she was staring and they see this as a sign of aggression. I did have a monkey climb on my back and take a nap for about 20 minutes - what fun.
North America,"Just a nice walk through the ""jungle"" with monkeys. Not sure what's the big deal is, but a decent walk around the place. We spent about an hour and left. The monkeys themselves are pretty friendly. If you use your common sense, you can have fun with some good pictures. I took a video of a monkey trying to take the top off a Chinese woman -- hilarious!"
North America,"If you love monkeys, this is a great experience. I recommend going first thing when they open, because it quickly gets crowded. Do not take any food with you or loose items, such as sun glasses. The monkeys will crawl on you and steal them. And remember, you are going to their habitat and are a visitor; respect them and the environment."
North America,"My wife and I visited Bali on our honeymoon and made a point to stop by the monkey forest. There are many monkeys there and the number of visitors at times made the experience a bit overwhelming. The one thing that was not awesome about our experience was when I get bit on the right hand by one of the Macaques. Luckily it didn't bleed but out of an abundance of caution I went to BIMC Ubud (local private hospital) the next day and they recommended Verorab (anti-rabies vaccination) as well as tetanus since I wasn't up to date on that. I got 3 of the 4 required shots while in Bali plus the tetanus which set me back about $200USD which is kind of non-awesome. In summary, it is cool to see them in the 'wild' but you do have to be careful around them and DO NOT bring any bags, lose articles, or anything of any perceived value, actual or otherwise, into the park because they [Macaques] will find a way to get to it."
North America,"You can spend hours here watching the monkeys in their environment, We only had about 4 hours and didn't even get to the back of the forest. We did spend alot of time just sitting in a peaceful place and after a while the monkeys will come right up to you and climb on your lap. I wouldn't move quickly or try and pet them, just let them climb.

If for some reason you get there after hours and don't have time to come back the next day just take a walk down the path to the left of the main gate or to the right of the back gate. You will see them bouncing around the trees in the park.

If you are planning a stay in the area I would also recommend staying at Alam Indah, It abuts the monkey forest and you can see and hear then from the villas.It is just steps from the rear entrance and an easy walk into town,"
North America,Good wildlife management in effect. The Park Rangers are professional and prevelent. The area is very dank and wet and primordial.
North America,Went early before it got too crowded. It is close to everything but a world away from the hustle and bustle of town. Seeing the monkeys up close was amazing. Really enjoyed our time there. Definitely spend a couple hours while in town.
North America,"My wife visited here recently during a day trip to Ubud Central. She was skeptical because she was scared of the monkeys and the idea of them jumping on her. Reluctantly, we gave it a shot, and was pleasantly surprised. The monkeys were very amusing to watch. I never saw any jump on anyone or try to steal anything that wasn't food. One did tug on a girl's dress, but not violently. The place was busy, but to be expected. We spent about an hour walking through the park which was very well maintained. Bathrooms were clean and free once admission was paid. There were many places to sit and plenty of areas of shade."
North America,I had such a great time seeing all the monkeys. I was a little nervous at first that the monkeys may be aggressive but not one monkey attempted to jump on us or take our things.
North America,"I was scared to visit the Monkey Forest, but my husband really wanted to so I reluctantly agreed to go. If anyone else is in the same boat, know this: if you use common sense and obey the guidelines regarding monkey behavior, you will be FINE. I loved watching the monkeys at the various feeding stations throughout the Forest. Watching them eat and play with each other was adorable. I also enjoyed meandering through the forest and seeing the beautiful stone sculptures. It was an afternoon I wonâ€™t soon forget."
North America,"It was a blast until I got bit.

I read the warnings on here prior to my visit and I followed all of the rules. No eye contact, no showing teeth, no food on me or feed them, no sunglasses, and no hat. The monkey bit me in the back unprovoked and drew blood. Second monkey climbed on me and bit me in the back of the head...also unprovoked.

The staff claims no rabies and the monkeys are tested. How is that done when they can roam free? They can also easily interact with the rabid dogs in Bali.

Now I'm undergoing rabies shots in the US which is expensive."
North America,"Appears to be a well cared for facility and park. It was clear of litter and the paths swept. Admission cost was 50k rupiah each. There is a small cafe in the main building and many places to sit before and after your walk. Once youâ€™re into the forest, shade is abundant and cooling. We walked in, so I cannot speak to parking.

Monkeys tend to congregate in the areas where there is food. Employees feed them corn and root vegetables. There is water moving through the park in small stone troughs, so they have access.

The only instances of aggression I saw were between monkeys. They would walk by people, and rather closely, but frightened easily. My husband sneezed and an adolescent monkey was so startled he dropped his food and misplaced it. A group of adolescent monkeys were curious about the water bottle a man had in his hand, and I did make sure I kept nothing in my hands unless I was using it in the moment (camera, etc.).

The highlight for me was seeing the baby monkeys. There were many and quite small. A mother monkey was holding her infant and they had fell asleep! What appeared to be a large family, cuddled up the six of them. Very social and beautiful animals!"
North America,"The entrance has increased in price to 80K in March and that is about $6. The monkeys are everywhere! They are eating, fighting, playing, trying to crack coconuts, swinging on trees all around you. There are even assistants there to help you take pictures with them. One tried to grab my bag so I understood why there were so many of them after. Fantastic facilities with shade and concrete statues galore. TONS of people may be the only downside and of course the heat."
North America,"This is a nice walk through the forest. There tons of monkeys; they can be very aggressive, stealing sunglasses and anything they can quickly take out of a purse. The babies were the cutest and watching them dive in and out of water was pretty entertaining."
North America,"Interesting place to see monkeys. Can get up close to them, seem to be partially domesticated as it is a tourist attraction. I went in the afternoon (maybe around 3pm) as it was part of my tour, booked through the hotel tour desk. It was not crowded then and the monkeys seemed tame. In the car prior to arriving my guide did suggest that I leave my hat and glasses in the car, as monkeys are known to steal them. The staff person I was with, she explained about the monkeys, some of the trees, the temple. And of course the staffers have little shops there, and a stop is part of the tour (that's why I'm giving it 4 out of 5). There was lots of shops, she told me over 200!"
North America,For the cheap price this is a great experience you must go to if you are in UBUD! The monkeys are treated very nicely here. and it is not a zoo the monkeys can actually leave at any time they are not enclosed.
North America,"Make sure you put away anything that they can grab: hats, sun glasses, ear rings. Because they will try.

It took us about 30 minutes to walk through the park and the monkeys were everywhere. Plenty of photo ops.

Just be careful they will jump on you and try and take things."
North America,"Fun place to visit! Great view everywhere. Monkeys all over! Staff was friendly and great. We felt safe and the monkeys were not bad, and when you felt unsure there was plenty of staff around to help. The place was very clean and it was a visually well cared for. We loved it!"
North America,"We enjoyed a leisurely walk through this gorgeous Forest watching the monkeys eat, groom and play. Disappointing to watch other people taunt and disrespect the safety guidelines just for a photo or a face to face experience with a wild animal. The scenery is stunning but there are people everywhere."
North America,"Bali was a relaxation vacation for us so we didn't venture out much. The monkey sanctuary was a must for us though. Fascinating place that didn't disappoint. If you like monkeys, you need to go."
North America,We loved the forest! My boyfriend has a granola bar packaged and buried in his backpack. The monkeys smelled it and immediately opened his bag and took it.
North America,I wasnâ€™t even going to go here as it didnâ€™t seem to be very special. You can see monkeys everywhere. I was told by someone that it was awesome so I went. This place was like no other monkey place. There were tons of them all over. I was watching a bunch of them getting fed and as I moved over to see better I almost stepped on one. Many monkeys were carrying around newborns. They were adorable. You can put food on your arm and they will sit on you and eat. The whole setting was pretty and very natural. The cost was minimal.
North America,"We had a great experience in the Ubud Sacred Monkey Forest. The grounds are lovely to walk around in, and of course the monkeys are everywhere. If you are able to follow the simple directions (no eye contact, don't touch them, etc) you should have a wonderful time. Main office/ticketing area has restrooms, ATM, and other services. Plan to spend at least an hour here to explore and enjoy seeing the monkeys up close!"
North America,"Pretty forest with small amphitheater and a number of stairs. Monkeys roam freely and are well fed by staff. Do NOT bring any food or drink with you and remove anything loose from your person (sunglasses, scarf, earbuds) and your purse/backpack, as the monkeys are very curious and stole a friend's hand sanitizer that dangled from her purse. Some workers will help you get a photo using treats that appears as if a monkey took it! You will also see the monkeys hanging around the street/sidewalk and roofs around the forest."
North America,"ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š Iâ€™m all smiles when I think about these lil creatures who can be so playful and aggressive at the same time. I had the experience of visiting the sanctuary and I was just in awe. It was a beautiful day and all the monkeys seem to be all hanging out. Well we were in their home so what else would they do?! It was a real tickled treat. I got to be up, close and a lil personal with them. They were the cutest. We couldnâ€™t or were not allowed to touch or feed them. I got pretty close to them and thatâ€™s all that mattered. Wish I could have held one just for the experience. Maybe next time. Their habitat was a wonderful place. With a lot of trees, stream like areas with water running through. You just had to be careful not to slip as some areas because it was damp, was a bit slippery. Just wear comfy and possibly rubber soles or nonslip shoes. It was a really wonderful day to gone and visit with them."
North America,"My kids and we were very excited to visit this place. The monkeys are wild but friendly. You have to be careful and keep your water bottle as well as hold your belongings and glasses really well. We also visited a place where we got dressed like the locals and took pictures with fruit bats and snakes. My kids loved it a lot! We had a really good driver that I would highly recommend from â€œ Airindo Bali Toursâ€, his name is Gusri and he was great in showing us all the local areas."
North America,Walking around the complex was really nice. The paths and temples were very pretty. The macaque monkeys were abundant and you could get some really neat photos of them. Be careful and pay attention to the posted instructions so as to be safe. I had two monkey jump on my at one point which made for quite a memorable experience! A must see place in Ubud.
North America,"My villa was less than a block away from the monkey forest and I ended up going twice while I was there. The backstory is very interesting and the monkeys were very entertaining! I read the rules and I didnâ€™t have any problems with the monkeys I did witness them get into backpacks and take items from other visitors. They werenâ€™t aggressive but I understand they can be! while visiting Ubud, put this on your list."
North America,A nice way to get out of the sun and sit in some shade to refai your strength before hitting the streets of Ubud again. A well laid out park with monkeys everywhere. Just sit down and watch the hilarity unfold in front of you. Not to expensive and a food place to hide for a while and walk in the jungle surrounded by the city.
North America,"The place is very cute and filled with monkeys. But, BEWARE OF MONKEYS STEALING YOU STUFF! SERIOUSLY!! Better not wearing jewelry or food with you. A group of monkeys stole my friend's backpack!! Yes, it was an organized crime! We almost lost all out documents and money with that backpack. Only one brave guy decided to help us... It was quite a battle!"
North America,"This is a cleanly-kept sanctuary for monkeys where they are happy, healthy and really beautiful to look at. The grounds keeper fed the monkeys twice during our 1 hour visit and the monkeys looked so incredibly happy. This is one place that should receive the positive attention it deserves as they care so well for the animals. A MUST SEE in Bali."
North America,"A pleasant surprise in the middle of Ubud. We almost missed this attraction because after hearing so much about aggressive monkey's in Uluwatu, we didn't want to end our vacay with an animal attack. But this was not the case here at the Monkey Forest Sanctuary. The monkeys are well fed. Well fed monkeys means monkeys on their (for the most part) best behavior. Just don't run or scream. The grounds here are beautiful. In some places, it's hard to believe you're in the middle of Ubud. We spent about an hour walking around, taking photos, etc. Nice place to visit."
North America,"This was one of many stops on our honeymoon. If youâ€™re in Bali, itâ€™s a must visit. Whether you like monkeys or not, this is a place to see. Also, be careful not to have anything hanging or even a hat on your head. I had a monkey climbed and sat on my shoulder just to run off with my hat lol....of course I never got it back."
North America,You must do this while you're in Bali. The monkeys will entertain you and may even jump on you. If they do don't panic. They just want to play for a few moments. Dress comfortably and wear mosquito repellant.
North America,"Yes, there are tons of monkeys. And they're naughty and tourists are stupid all around you having things stolen, but there's a lot more to the Sacred Monkey Forest that makes it worth a visit besides cute monkeys. There are incredibly ornate ancient temples dating to the 14th century, a natural ravine complete with things like a komodo dragon just doing its thing, stone carvings and temporary graves for Hindu Balinese people before their bodies are cremated and dispersed into the sea every 5 years. It's really a fascinating place. And the monkeys have called it home for centuries, aren't fenced in and just stay there."
North America,Must visit spot in Ubud - cool to see the monkeys up close and also a big enough park with interesting architecture.
North America,Visited 1/13/19 amazing time with my daughter. She was extra friendly with them. They climbed on her back and tried to open her bag for snacks. I was a bit nervous ðŸ˜¬ but loved the look on her face.
North America,If you like monkeys this is a place to spend about an hour. They go about doing their business and occasional lash out at tourists. Don't bring food or stare at them
North America,"Great for both kids and adults. Be careful or the monkeys will take your hats or glasses. However, the rangers will get them back to you by feeding eggs to the monkeys..Great for photographers."
North America,This was a great place to relax and go for a walk with the monkeys. There were a ton of them. I loved watching the moms and very newborn babies. I took a great video of one of the monkeys eating potatoes and people watching. I now have many many monkey pictures to take home. I really enjoyed the Monkey Forest.
North America,"What a beautiful place. Be prepared. Monkeys will touch you, steal from you and jump on you. No plastic bags should be visible. Make sure anything you have on you is tied on! Monkeys will steal your eyeglasses or anything that will entertain them. One monkey reached into my bag and took my eyeglass case."
North America,"Loved seeing the monkeys, especially the mama monkeys with their babies. Right near center and easy to get to!"
North America,"I wasnâ€™t too impressed with the monkey forest but my friends were. There are hundreds of monkeys just walking around doing their thing while you walk thru the forest. Do not have ANYTHING hanging as the monkeys will steal it (one took my hand sanitizer and tried to eat it lol).

Overall itâ€™s a good place to spend 30mins. Just an FYI -Outside you get harassed to buy stuff very aggressively."
North America,"My husband and I recently visit the sacred monkey sanctuary and loved it. I did plenty of reading before hand, so we can prepared. No hats, nothing dangling or loose from our backpacks and no visible bottles on the outside of our bags either. We also didnâ€™t attempt to feed the monkeys and respected their space. As such our visit was pleasant and fun. Theyâ€™re really cute and funny but I did see some get a little aggressive with other guests. One grabbed a hat from a childâ€™s head and ran away with it, obviously the child (6-7 yrs old or so) was super scared. I also saw another rip a baby bottle out of someoneâ€™s backpack (it was on a side pocket). Neither situation seemed great but also... follow the rules and you wonâ€™t have these problems. We saw two monkeys that jumped on or grabbed at someone but those interactions were brief, friendly and funny and everything was fine. Only one person seemed to be in a rough situation when a monkey jumped on her head and her boyfriend thought it a good idea to get in his face to take pictures... it agitated the monkey and it got a little ugly. Overall, follow the rules, and respect their space and youâ€™ll have a lovely experience and great pictures!"
North America,Felt like a kid at the zoo except the monkeys were free in the forest. Was such a fun afternoon activity.
North America,Feel like visiting a sacred part of Jurassic park. Beautiful places with temples and nature interacting at all points. Just watch out with the monkeys.
North America,We had a tour guide take my husband and I to a few spots in Ubud and this was one of them. It was amazing! A really cool up close and personal view of the monkeys. If youâ€™re in Ubud definitely check it out!
North America,"Like many other things in Bali, this place is relatively staged and a somewhat bastardized version of a true nature reserve type sanctuary. Itâ€™s good that theyâ€™ve discouraged people from feeding monkeys now, but the staff still use food to get pictures for tourists. While they were more often too busy humoring tourist photo ops, I can appreciate that at times, if they felt a monkey was getting too touchy or spending too much time near someone, they would throw food as a decoy for the personâ€™s escape. Iâ€™d say that if you want to come here, just set your expectations and stay a reasonable distance away from the monkeys (they are still wild after all). Ladies, donâ€™t wear skirts/dresses either. I saw two girls who ended up screaming and getting scratched after monkeys were playing with and curiously going up their skirts."
North America,"If youd seen any videos of the sacred monkey forest you might be terrified of heading into the monkey forest, I know I was but you dont have to be. Before you enter there are a list of suggestions/ rules to follow, if you need the warnings you'll be fine. Font bring food or loose articles with you as they are curious creatures. The monkeys can and will open your backpack if they think they smell food. Momma will bite if they think you are threatening their young so dont make sudden movements if the younglings are on you. Just start walking and theyll jump off. If you're calm and respect them you shouldn't have any issue. I had a great time here and one of the staff got me a Great monkey selfie for a small donation."
North America,"We spent about 90 minutes walking through the Monkey Forest and it was wonderful. There are about 900 monkeys that play and run wild. Just make sure to follow the posted rules while here.

Definitely worth the 80,000 rupiah. Go earlier in the day for less people."
North America,We enjoyed our visit to the Monkey Forest. The monkeys are very cute and the forest is beautiful. Its a nice place to spend an hour or two.
North America,"My brother was trying to put bottle of water in my backpack, and close the bag.
Suddenly the monkey jumped to my back and trying to open it. I was scared lol. Forest attendant flicked something to make monkey go away. Later the another monkey steal the water from my uncleâ€™s hand and opened it to drink. Threw the water bottle on the floor. When we trying to pick it up to trash it, another monkey grabbed it. Becareful donâ€™t bother grab it back itâ€™s dangerous. But we have fun there"
North America,The monkeys are very comfortable around humans so you will see so much of their real routines as if in the wild. The sanctuary is well kept.
North America,Monkeys who let you get right up close but who are free to go where they please. An absolutely incredible experience - their behaviour is so entertaining!
North America,"A lot of walking... the monkeys can be aggressive itâ€™s quite a walk when trying to get out

The have a shuttle back to the palac. Every 15 minutes but on break from 1:30 - 2:15"
North America,No visit to Ubud is complete without a visit to the Sacred Money Forest Sanctuary. A unique experience to roam freely amongst these creatures and watch their interactions. The forest itself is also beautiful to explore with some temples scattered throughout.
North America,"The new entrance is very nice. The old trees, the great vibes and the lovely monkeys make this place just magical
Must do, i did it already twice in 3 weeks holiday"
North America,"Iâ€™m not a big fan of traditional â€œtouristâ€ places, yet this place is such a joy! Itâ€™s also a nice escape from a noisy town. I like the fact that there is staff across the forest; theyâ€™ve made us feel safe and protected."
North America,"If you are in Ubud, than you must visit. Great with kids, but please always keep an eye on them, and donâ€™t let them run around, bc some of the monkeys could be a bit aggressive if they are being touched. Amazing surrounding with a lot of monkeys all around."
North America,"I'm not a huge animal fan, but it was interesting to see the monkey forest. Just don't go inside with any food or an open bag. The monkeys are very smart."
North America,Beautiful and serene. The monkeys are fascinating but need to be respected. The sanctuary is not very large and so plan for between one and two hours from entry to exit.
North America,"This was an interesting 1.5 hour stop. Listed as the number 1 attraction in Ubud - but I felt it could easily be missed. Like a relatively small park with monkeys roaming freely. Seems to be all the same type of monkey, so it gets less interesting over time spent. The landscape very nice, but after an hour, you have seen it all. Not much in the way of guides or explanations. Just walk around and see monkeys."
North America,"Overall great place to interact with wildlife. As I say the main attraction is you. The monkeys are watching you. Be extremely careful with possessions, bags...etc. These monkeys are not afraid of humans."
North America,Just watch out for little thiefs!!! They come from behind and steal your glasses or other belongings.
North America,Fun to see monkeys running around so freely. Just don't make eye contact and hold onto your water bottle. There's a famous selfie photo where it looks like the monkey is taking it. They no longer do that and the sanctuary keepers will tell you that too.
North America,"No business like monkey business. Be careful of your loose belongings (Particularly caps and sunglasses) as the monkeys are kleptomaniacs (Not kidding. They will snatch something when you're not looking and run off in a tree with it. It will happen even to seasoned locals.)

However, it is very interesting to watch and interact with the monkeys, and you can pay a tiny bit extra for bags of peanuts to feed them. Also the usual touristy goods are available.

In addition to the monkeys, they also have an area where you can feed and pose with fruit bats, for a nominal fee. I know some people like bats but these ones are truly docile and it's kind of cute when you feed them juice.

If in Bali, will definitely consider visiting here again."
North America,Was definitely worth a stop. The monkeys were entertaining and the Flora was old Growth Banyan trees.
North America,Monkeys everywhere from big to small I read a lot of reviews on the monkeys being aggressive but didnâ€™t experience nothing of the sort seen a lot of nervous people walking around but thereâ€™s a lot of staff in the sanctuary keeping the monkeys in line . I had one come behind me while taking closeup pic of another monkey trying to take paper out my pocket but it ran off
North America,"There were plenty of monkeys to see. When left to them selves, they were calm and didnâ€™t try to interact with the many visitors. The highlight for me was watching a group of monkeys jump in a pool by a fountain. They were really having fun."
North America,"This place is iconic but brings a risk. These are wild monkeys that can be dangerous. Dont make eye contact, bring any time of food, bags, dont even put glasses on your head. These monkeys look for reasons to jump on you."
North America,"What could be more fun than monkeys?! This park is very well maintained and easily accessible, with a moderate amount of walking. There are guidelines for viewing the monkeys and rangers that ensure close interactions are limited. The photo opportunities are around every corner because the feeding stations guarantee the monkeys will be out and about. I only regret I did not stop at the merchant stalls."
North America,"Great trip to see the monkeys. They were mildly aggressive, attempting (and succeeding) to get into our backpack to look for food. Harmless for the most part, and lots of rangers around to help. We had to have seen over 100 monkeys on our visit - a little touristy, but nice to get REALLY close and personal. So many cute babies and elders having monkey fun!"
North America,"My husband and I were staying right down the street, so we actually went in the monkey forest on 3 separate occasions. Itâ€™s such a wonderful place - very different than anywhere weâ€™ve been in the US. Just be advised that they love anything shiny. Cameras were okay (use a wrist or neck strap), but bottled water and sunglasses were up for grabs. If one jumps on you, just relax and enjoy it! They are just curious and very food-motivated. Just donâ€™t look them in the eye, get too close to the babies unless they come to you, or the food and youâ€™ll be fine. We had a couple of babies jump on us just by crouching and being patient nearby. Such a fun experience!!"
North America,"To be honest, I was very apprehensive about going. Iâ€™d read so much conflicting stuff about the monkey forest that I would have been fine to just skip it altogether. But my wife wanted to go, so go we did. First off, there was great parking, signage, and nice facilities with bathrooms (even bathrooms throughout). If youâ€™ve been to Bali, you know how rare this is. Most paths were wide, easy to walk on, and there is plentiful staff stationed throughout to distract the monkeys with food, and also to intervene should a monkey get a little to monkey-ish. The forest itself was beautiful, they have some gorgeous temples and trees throughout. As for the monkeys... they behave as monkeys. You get to see them do what they do, which includes a lot of stuffing their faces, grooming each other, playing, and even some fighting. I brought no food, no bags, left my sunglasses behind. I read the signs EVERYWHERE that warn you to not hide food, not feed them, donâ€™t stare at them in the eye- and guess what? They werenâ€™t interested in me in the least. If youâ€™re just nonchalantly observing and you follow the posted guidelines, youâ€™ll be perfectly fine. They arenâ€™t kidding about not looking them in the eye- my wife took a picture of one perched on a branch above her and accidentally looked it in the eye while doing so- it climbed down to hiss right in her face and swat at her. I watched another woman intentionally square herself up in front of a larger male monkey, looked at him with her hands on her hips, and he immediately began going for her (she started screaming and running away so I guess he won ðŸ˜†). One last note- we got there early, around 8:45. By 10:30 it was getting busy and we were ready to go. Get there early."
North America,"Fabulous. We visited early in the morning because it was cooler. Luckily this is when the monkeys are fed and they were too busy eating to get up to any mischief. Please take notice of the warnings, we did and had a great time. Wear flat shoes, there are a lot of steps going down into the valley, itâ€™s a workout. Donâ€™t take food or drink with you, there is a cafe at the entrance and plenty of places outside the forest. There is a left luggage facility if you need it, as the monkeys apparently like to steel bags. There is also a cash machine and clean looâ€™s. The paths through the forest were swept and free of poo and leaves.
Respect the monkeys and you will be fine. We took loads of photos and they were quite happy to sit and pose for you, just use the zoom on your phone/camera.
We only saw one incident, whilst we were there. A man decided to take a selfie and got into the personal space of three small monkeys. Needless to say, they snarled and showed their teeth. He quickly backed off, but it could have been a very different story and he would only have himself to blame.
Only one negative, it would have been nice to see more information about the monkeys.
We spent a lovely morning wondering around the forest and would recommend it to other visitors."
North America,Enjoyable morning out. The entrance fee is very cheap and the site has hidden gems and temples. The monkeys are also good entertainment but you must be aware to follow the rules when it comes to monkey behaviour and hang onto your belongings.
North America,"If you are in Ubud, everyone recommends the Monkey Forest and it really is a great experience! I was a little wary to begin with as when entering the forest, there are a lot of signs on what to do if a monkey approaches you and how to act. However, the monkeys are amazing, super inquisitive and very friendly.
As with all wild animals, you have to respect them and they will respect you. We only saw 'misbehaved' monkeys when people were intimidating or teasing them. Thankfully there are staff members and rangers everywhere and they are on hand to help anyone who is a little frightened or would like a great photo of them and the monkeys (for a price).
We were told it would take an hour to go around the forest, but to be honest, we were there for about 3 hours and it's because we loved it and there was so much to see."
North America,"The entrance fee is IR80,000 which is really good value. They have a walk which is not too strenuous and also another with a lot of stairs. Monkeys are around everywhere. As long as you are not carrying food and water they stay away. The ranger do a great job, even taking pictures for you."
North America,"Totally LOVED this place. I was in Ubud for 5 weeks and visited Monkey Forest weekly. The monkeys are fascinating and are very well-behaved if you don't approach them quickly or aggressively. Watch your belongings. They love things that are hanging down, like bag handles. It's super hot and humid in there, so make sure you bring water to rehydrate."
North America,"This place was stunning. It felt like you were in the jungle book movie: Huge trees, ancient buildings, rivers, and a whole bunch of monkeys."
North America,This was wonderful to visit. You must buy bananas and feed the monkeys. They can be aggressive though so don't tease them. And don't leave anything dangling from a backpack or purse because THEY WILL grab it. But this was a beautiful walk through a lush forrest right by the temple and river.
North America,"We really enjoyed our visit experience. Read the signage and adhere to the rules. The keepers (young staff gentlemen) keep an eye on things to keep order for both the monkeys and the visitors. Signage is very good throughout the area, but be aware that there is lots of walking on paths, and some areas are reachable only by numerous steps or very small paths but the area is very pretty and thick with trees. It was so interesting to watch them feed the monkeys at the specific feeding stations (plants, corn, fruit). We spent about 2 hours there and enjoyed it alot!"
North America,"Donâ€™t miss this place! It is a natural beauty even without the more than 1,000 monkeys. We were awe struck by the giant trees and lovely pathways that make up this spectacular park. It is worth every last rupiah for the entrance fee.

The monkeys are used to people and they allow you to come close. To see a tiny baby monkey clinging to its mother is precious beyond belief. To watch them play and interact with each other could fill an entire day."
North America,Beautiful area in the jungle. The monkeys were everywhere you looked. Lots of tourists here. Worth a visit.
North America,"Honestly I spoke with some people and they said it was basically a tourist trap. I agree and disagree. This is a sanctuary and the monkeys are really cared for. They run free so you can get up close(no touch) and they are not afraid and not aggressive but they are wild animals. Leave your food and drinks in the car.
The park is pretty big and well maintained. I enjoyed my visit and would recommend this for a family and is a great experience to see free roaming monkeys. Not a common site."
North America,"Spent the first of the final three days, of a 10-day group trip to Bali, by kicking off the solo part of my travels in Ubud's Sacred Monkey Forest. The monkeys are playful, rambunctious, and aggressive. They will fearlessly approach you and attempt to grab at items you may have. I had one walk over, sit on my lap and try to pry my beach bag apart. It would have been successful had I not already been warned by the signs posted at the entrance of the sanctuary suggesting visitors remove loose fitting jewelry, scarves, hats, etc. and to secure their purses and bags. Previous online travel research also hipped me to the fact that the monkeys were able and would try to remove items from backpacks if given the chance. Also, try to avoid taking anything that looks like or resembles a staff/cane with a snake or dragon's head. I bought one at a souvenir shop for my son on the way there, and thought it would also be a good weapon in case I had to ward off any overly-aggressive monkeys. It instead had a double-negative effect. Not only did the staff/cane instantly grab their attention, but it almost hypnotically, mesmerized them and drew them to it. But, not in a most friendly way. Other nearby visitors took notice, as well as the couple I had connected with at the start of the forest when we both stared at the warning signs with concern and then struck up conversation.....
>> Follow me on my Food & Travel page on IG @thegourmetglobetrotter for remainder of this review, photos and more."
North America,Right in town so easy to visit. Better than a zoo as no cages and animals free to interact normally with several distinct groups on the grounds. Clean and well maintained. Unfortunately the temples are closed to visitors. Admission slightly higher than for other attractions. Young children might be frightened by inquisitive and aggressive individuals
North America,"Thoroughly enjoyed watching all the monkey games. Follow the rules/suggestions and you will have fun and not be the subject of stories in the future. Donâ€™t bring food or water bottles. No dangling earrings nothing swinging in your hands leave your hat behind too.
The forest grew on the cemetery and that is why it is sacred ground."
North America,"Fun place to explore on a hot day! Lots of beautiful trees, nice walking paths through the jungle, near temples and a stream. It was cool to see the monkeys relaxing, playing, and eating in the forest. So amazing that this space exists in the city - highly recommended!"
North America,"The Monkey Forest lives up to its name. Full of playful (and a few misbehaving) monkeys, this is a must-see visit for adults and children alike. The monkeys are everywhere in the forest and always looking for something to eat. Be sure to check out the dragon bridge also, which is down a long stairway in the middle of the forest."
North America,"This was a fun experience, although a little terrifying for me because I am not a fan of monkeys. People walked right by the monkeys. Great for a photo shoot."
North America,Our visit was very authentic and gave us a good understanding of the monkey habitat and family unit. It was great seeing them in their natural habitat. Must see in Ubud.
North America,Nice little day trip. The monkeys were not mean in the slightest contrary to everything I read. They'll leave you alone if you do the same. Some of them will even climb on you if you want them to.
North America,"Iâ€™m glad we went here during our trip to Bali, but Iâ€™m also glad we didnâ€™t stay long. The monkeys are very cute and are very used to people. Theyâ€™ll walk right up to you! The park says thereâ€™s over a 1,000 there so youâ€™re guaranteed to see at least a dozen of them. Itâ€™s full of tourists though, which ended up being quite annoying as people are trying to get selfies with the monkey, hold the monkeys, etc."
North America,I have been to Uluwatu many moons ago and didn't have a good experience with the mischievous monkeys. At Ubud forest the monkeys were a little bit more friendlier but I still had the uneasy feeling walking around them. At one point we felt like we were surrounded by 40 monkeys but luckily the park ranger (pawang) was there to watch them closely. I would recommend as a must thing to experience but do follow the rules and respect the culture.
North America,so many monkeys everywhere. Donâ€™t really need to go to the Sanctuary to see them all. Just walk around Ubud but be careful. They steal your bags. They are fairly aggressive.
North America,"We had a great time in Bali, The Monkey forest was one of the coolest places I've ever been to. I Highly recommended visiting Sacred Monkey forest and all of Bali it was amazing"
North America,"Once finding and paying to enter we felt a little silly to realize that many of the monkeys could just as easily be seen from the surrounding streets for free. Since you can no longer feed the monkeys, thereâ€™s little reason to pay to enter. Tip: Most of the stern appearing guides will quickly accept a tip to get a monkey on your back for a photo. We didnâ€™t take advantage but saw this occur several times during our short stroll through the forest."
North America,"A really wonderful sanctuary for Monkeys. The forest allows monkeys to run free.

Be careful of your stuff, they might try to take some from you! Also make sure you're not too close, they'll try and bite you too if you agitate them. Other than that, the monkeys are super cute and interesting to observe!

A little crowded at times during feeding time, but there's lots of space for a large amount of people. The entry fee is really reasonable for what you get to experience and see during your time at the forest. Definitely a must-visit when you're in Ubud!"
North America,"Based on pictures I was expecting to be attached or followed. They are in their habitat and as long as weâ€™re not trying to bother them itâ€™s great. Saw many types, different ages and the beauty of their daily lives.
Loved every minute of it, even when a child monkey took my yellow dress for maybe a banana and tried eating it!"
North America,"They are sneaky monkeys, watched 2 people have their sunglasses and a water bottle snatched quickly. A beautiful jungle forest, lots of monkeys to take pics of, and watch. Very peaceful..."
North America,"monkeys were fun to watch. great for families or solos. nature and trees were beautiful. be careful, a monkey jumped on me, opened my bag and took out 2 pepcid pills, in seconds. the monkey chewed on them. guy working there said monkey would be ok though so that's good."
North America,"This is a must-do activity in ubud. Great for kids, just donâ€™t get handsy with the monkeys. For $5ish USD you can walk around a beautiful forest and see the monkeys play and eat in their natural habitat."
North America,"It was very fun to be able to spend some time with the monkeys. The forest is beautiful, very green. There are a lot of monkeys. We walked around the whole sanctuary. We did it early around 8:30 AM so it wasnâ€™t too packed. We noticed it getting a little bit more crowded as we were leaving. It took us about 1 hour to walk all of the forest."
North America,"Had a good time there, so many monkeys in a beautiful setting. Take time and wonder around. Warning, hide your stuff. The monkeys will jump on you and take anything shiney or loose lol. We never had them jump on us but saw it happen to several people a few got bit but they all seemed to think it was worth it as they got bandaged and kept going."
North America,"It was great watching the monkeys in the wild having fun in such a beautiful place. They are not shy at all! You can easily spend a couple hours hiking, taking pics and watching the monkeys."
North America,I love monkeys so of course I loved this. Some interesting cultural info too if you look for it. Easy walk from the palace in Ubud.
North America,Wonderful experience! We were able to walk up close to many monkeys including moms with babies! The area has beautiful grounds and the monkeys are well taken care of by the staff.
North America,"Hundreds of monkeys run ranpid through the forest jumping on customers and beg for food. Be carful, the monkeys are curious. If you have a backpack on a monkeys will try to open it, and if you try to shoo them off and upset them they will bite! I was bitten! apparently, numerous people are bitten daily and the workers are not bothered by this. I was given a swab of iodine to treat the wound and sent on my way. I later went to the local Ubud clinic where the wound was cleaned for 15 minutes and I was given antiviral pills. My tetanus shot was up to date so that was not needed. You have been warned! Save yourself the headache and the doctors visit!"
North America,"Enjoy a beautiful forest watching many, many monkeys as you make your way around the area. The monkeys don't interact with you, but go about their daily routines. Fun!"
North America,We did the monkey just because. We did the monkey thing in Costa Rica. Monkeys are monkeys go have fun. Put up food and glasses and cell phones. Itâ€™s a good time if you need a thing to do. But I have the philosophy that when you seen one monkey have seen them all.
North America,"The monkeys are everywhere! You get to see all
Of them up close and personal. A great stop on any tour!!!"
North America,"It's a nice facility. The monkeys seem well cared for and not too exploited. I got in and out quickly and got a good experience even at lunch time when it was quite busy. I did have friends who had monkey jump on them and steal from them, so be careful what you carry with you.The cost is 80,000 IRP for admittance and several exhibits are currently closed. That didn't bother me though since I didn't know what I was missing, but it might be something to keep in mind."
North America,"Filthy
Aggressive
Dangerous

As seasoned SE Asia travelers....
We donâ€™t see monkeys as cute...
Rather based on our experience...
Including Ubud...
Itâ€™s best to stay away...
And no matter what...
Donâ€™t have anything in your possession
That is a food or snack
That will just make you a target.

Cuddle monkeys...then make sure youâ€™ve had all the vaccinations...including rabies."
North America,"So many monkeys! Babies & mommas, dominant males and youngsters. We spent about 2 hours wandering around watching the monkeys and enjoying the beautiful surroundings. Must go when in Ubud."
North America,"Entering into this Sanctuary you are greeted with a warning signing, alarming you about what lies ahead. The architecture in this sanctuary is breathtaking, but beware, beware of what lurks in between the trees. They will seem all innocent, cute and cuddly but remember there is a warning sign before entering. Seemingly I was more intrigued with the design of the sanctuary than the monkeys! Despite having a monkey try to snatch my friends bag from out her hands, we had an unforgettable experience."
North America,I wasnâ€™t going to go cause once you have seen a monkey up close well....but I was curious nonetheless. I appreciate the sanctuary and the special surroundings of this place.Go but follow the rules. Watch your belongings however cause Monkeys are fast and mischievous.
North America,Monkeys old and young wandering about and just.being curious. Watch your hats and packs! They are known to grab hats and sunglasses or bottles of water. Do not feed the monkeys unless their handlers/guardians tell you to. They can be demanding animals sometimes when you feed give them food. All in all it was a fun experience!
North America,"Pretty well kept ! Must do in Ubud , monkeys are friendly if you respect their space . Gorgeously walk and perfect for families."
North America,Los of monkeys everywhere. We had a cool local guide and it did not cost much. I sat down to rest and a monkey got on my back.
North America,"My wife and I stayed at Bali Bohemia right across the street from the Monkey Forest. We went to the sanctuary right away. When you enter there are monkeys everywhere. The forest itself is amazing. The monkeys are playful and territorial with each other. They were really fun to watch. After one was done swimming, he decided to climb up my wife soaking wet. Pretty funny! I would love to go back. It was such a neat place."
North America,Had a very nice time walking through the forest. There are monkeys everywhere giving great opportunities for photos. Beware of monkeys that will steal and run with anything you lay down. We witnessed a monkey run to a backpack a lady set down and it unzipped the backpack and ran away with her wallet. The forest is laid out nicely so you can spend as much time here as you like.
North America,super fun!! everyone needs to go and try once. monkeys are fine if you just walk by and donâ€™t stare at them in the eye
North America,"Touristy, but lots of monkeys. They are accustomed to humans and will steal your stuff. Most are friendly and the photography opportunities are everywhere."
North America,"So much fun to watch the monkeys playing and being fed. The location is in the town of Ubud, so walkable if you are staying there. The forest is lovely and the temple buildings are worth a look. Just be careful with hats, sunglasses, and other loose items as the monkeys are curious."
North America,"I thought the monkey forest was really nice. It is clean, well maintained and there is no shortage of monkeys. Some can be aggressive because people care more about a photo than following the rules. Donâ€™t feed the monkeys, it makes them aggressive and lowers their quality of life, ALL so you can have a photo. I saw people bribing the handlers, giving monkeys food and I saw a guy get bit. Why, because he was not following the rules. This place is great and it is entertaining and enjoyable just watching the monkeys interact with each other and not humans. I will also suggest not bringing bags, water bottles or anything that has tassels on it. Monkey love tassels. ;) This place is large but try to find the watering hole the monkeys play in. They were hilarious to watch them swing and fall into the water. Spent about 90 minutes there. Be mindful of which exit you leave through. One puts you on a path where you have to walk 1 mile around the forest. It was enjoyable but unplanned."
North America,"These monkeys can be aggressive. Don't bring food, the monkeys will try to grab what's inside your backpack!"
North America,"The Monkey Sanctuary was beautiful, full of cute monkeys, that we were able to get quite close to. We loved our experience!"
North America,"This place is right in Ubud and easy to get to. We spent 1-1 1/2 hours walking through the sanctuary. There are paths through the sanctuary and monkeys everywhere. At certain locations, the caretakers feed the monkeys (chopping up corn on the cob and scattering it). The monkeys are pretty used to people, so you can walk right by if they're sitting on the sidewalk. Don't bring food or water - the monkeys may try to take it. We saw one monkey drinking from a water bottle."
North America,"Yes you will see monkeys, lots of them. We didnâ€™t have any issues with being attacked, jumped upon, or even any provocation from the monkeys. I was actually quite stunned to see the number of humans trying to entice the monkeys to engage them up close and personal. There are signs posted everywhere about the proper way to interact with the monkeys, which is to donâ€™t bother them. Having experienced monkeys numerous times in their natural habitats in the wild, we were as enamored with the whole experience as others. Yet, if this is your first time it can be a memorable experience. Just donâ€™t bother the monkeys so you can get a good picture. I would recommend some type of protection from bug bites as we were just about eaten alive."
North America,"If you like monkeys, this is the place to go. The Monkey Forest is right in the heart of Ubud and easy to get to. The price is very reasonable and you will see a ton of monkeys. You will see babies interacting with their family. The monkeys are not skittish at all and will get very close. Keep an eye on your sunglasses and other valuables, but it is definitely worth the visit."
North America,"Beautiful, clean. The monkeys were perfectly delightful and not vicious at all. There are a LOT of steps. Impressive banyan trees, interesting temples. In the middle was a surprise art gallery with gorgeous paintings of various styles for sale."
North America,Went here after a snorkel near the sanctuary. The experience was really unique and fun. The capuchin monkeys were so engaged with us crazy humans and having a sloth hold on to you and look in your eyes is so exciting.
North America,Nice place. Great scenery. Lots of monkeys to see and take pictures of. Two temples in there as well but we weren't able to go inside. They did have a small art gallery to see as well. We didn't see any monkeys jump on anyone. Probably because no one had any food in their hands.
North America,"Itâ€™s been about 5 years since our last trip to the sanctuary. We were delighted to see that there have been some improvements made to the sanctuary that not only benefits the viewers, but the monkeys as well. The sanctuary is much bigger which allows for the monkeys to roam freely. There are also pools that have been created to allow the monkeys a place to swim, bath, and drink water. There are also keepers who feed and make sure there arenâ€™t any altercations between monkeys and humans. Itâ€™s a lovely way to spend a few hours in Ubud."
North America,This is a must-do on a trip to Bali. The monkeys own the place and you are just a visitor. They roam free and are well fed. Don't forget to leave your shiny things at home
North America,"I really enjoyed the monkey forest. I had read all the horror stories about monkeys jumping on people and stealing their glasses, phones, and food so I was nervous going in, but I talked to a few people who were leaving who assured me it was all good.

I walked all over the beautiful monkey forest and watched the monkeys. The forest is a bit of a respite from the noisy streets nearby. As cute as the monkeys are, theyâ€™re not the best part of the forest. The architecture, the foliage, the surrounding jungle and the river are a beautiful place to relax."
North America,"If you like the first 15 minutes of Raiders of the Lost Ark, and you are amused by monkeys, then this is the spot for you."
North America,"You know what youâ€™re going to get just based on the name but itâ€™s still a treat. Itâ€™s amazing that right in the middle of the city there are a thousand monkeys in a natural habitat just being monkeys.
If you put yourself in the right place, they will get on your head, pick your pocket, take your sunglasses, lift your hat, or whatever. None of that will happen if you are aware and donâ€™t get too close. If you want it to, you can make it happen. It can be fun if you are in the right frame of mind - or you can just watch in amazement and joy.
It would be a shame if you missed this whether you are young or old, with or without kids but if you have kids or a young heart, go. Itâ€™s well done, the grounds are beautiful. Itâ€™s inexpensive. Itâ€™s shady. Whatâ€™s not to like."
North America,"A beautiful lush jungle filled with moneys everywhere. Admission is about $2.00. You walk around the jungle and observe the monkeys in the trees, on the ground, chasing each other, grooming and so much more."
North America,"One of the few Bali sights that isnâ€™t overhyped, the monkey forest delivers what it promises. The monkeys are everywhere and the temple is beautiful. Plentiful opportunities for pictures, but I donâ€™t recommend taking in bags if you can avoid it because monkeys will steal your belongings out of them. A must do!"
North America,Wasnâ€™t expecting quite the wild experience we got at the monkey forest. They are literally everywhere and itâ€™s likely youâ€™ll end up with one making you jump as it rushes past you. Itâ€™s a stunning walk around the forest with beautiful carvings and vines hanging for monkey mischief to happen. They are so great to watch.
North America,Donâ€™t miss exploring this beautiful and fascinating park in Ubud. The grounds are gorgeous and the monkeys wonderful.
North America,"It's a perfect morning walk. Pay the cheap fee (50,000 ruppiah) and wander around...there are tons of brand new babies clinging to their mothers and adolescents playing chase in the pools. The Balinese attendants there are kind and they'll answer questions and help you interact. You can tell that they care about the monkeys but they're also watchful for guest safety. I would recommend going back many times. Especially in the morning!"
North America,"I think of all the things we did in Bali this was probably the most fun. It's the only attraction my daughter actually want you to go back to.

These monkeys are real kick in the ass. They are full of personality and are cute as hell. Be very careful cuz they can be aggressive if you are holding food and will rip it right out of your hands if given the chance. But, I don't think there's any danger involved as they seem pretty used to tourists. This is a must-do thing and I don't have too many must do things"
North America,You should certainly stop in if visiting Ubud. Can do the whole park in 1-2 hours even without rushing. Goes without saying - but just follow the rules. Donâ€™t bring food in your bags (or even just donâ€™t bring bags if you donâ€™t need to) and leave the monkeys alone.
North America,"As the crowds increase in Ubud, this place also gets more crowded. And naturally it loses a lot of its charm. Also the monkeys are pretty jaded. I use to walk in here very early in the morning, but I suppose too many people did the same because now it is guarded by security. Too bad. It is not that I mind paying, but that it is cool and wonderful very early and sans the crowds. By the time the ticket office opens at 8:30 it is too late. Another victim of over-tourism."
North America,"This is such a fun place! Monkeys literally in hoards everywhere!!! They werenâ€™t approachable but if you donâ€™t mess with them, they wonâ€™t mess with you. Hold onto your glasses, hats and phones or they WILL take them from you."
North America,Definitely worth a visit if in Ubud. Staff is friendly and informative and the scenery within the forest area is amazing.
South America,"These little guys are funny and behave like rascals, make sure you donÂ´t have anything in your backpack or they will find and steal it! Specially fond of water bottles, just be careful when one approaches because he will jump you!"
South America,"I don't like monkeys a lot but the forest is incredible.

It's a must if you like nature.

Respect the animals, the people taking care of them know how to deal with them. Don't bring little colorful things, it could keep the monkeys attention and to be stolen.

It's a nice 1 hr. Walk. A lot of stairs if you have any kind of mobility issues.

"
South America,"1,000s of naughty monkeys and a big forest to take your time in. You get very close to the monkeys but donâ€™t touch or taunt them or they bite"
South America,"Better not taking anything with you if you go, because there are little guards and they give poor guidelines to prevent accidents.
I was carrying a bag with no food but a monkey was opening and biting it anyway, and then tried to bite me several times when I took it back."
South America,"A very special place, you can connect with yourself through the powerful energy of this place. The monkeys are used to be with humans,m so the experience is terrific."
South America,"A great experience but the monkeys are cheeky and like to play games - stealing sunglasses, phones and wallets being their favorite. If you lose an item good luck getting it back. Don't pat the babies as you risk attack from the mother and her gang - and a trip to the rabies clinic at the hospital."
South America,"Had a great time seeing the monkeys, the park, and playing with my daughters. They had a lot of fun."
South America,"It was really nice to see the monkeys around so close to us and super comfortable with all the tourists around taking pictures all the time. There are some restrictions obviously, because they are in their natural habitat, so we need to respect them! (Don't feed them, stare them or try to play around, because their reaction can be impredictabIe, just relax and watch them passing by and take some pictures, but respecting their space). I thought it would be one more touristical attraction, but in fact it was really chill. We walked around the forest where there are 3 temples ( they were unfortunately closed when we were there). Don't be scared if they come close to you, they are just curious! It was also funny to see them interecting with each other and there are differents species, so sometimes when they eventually meet they fight with each other! Just watch and do nothing!

The entrance fee is 80.000 Rupias per person. I recommend the experience!"
South America,Mildly awesome. My girlfriend liked monkey so she enjoyed. Not my thing. We arrived and they were feeding the monkeys so they were all in one place. You have to be careful to not stare the monkeys at their eyes and not to feed them.
South America,"For those who like animals, itâ€™s simply awesome! The monkeys donâ€™t care you are there. If you sit near them, they interact and you can see them all over the place. Also thereâ€™s a beautiful temple inside."
South America,"Incredible park in the middle of the Ubud city. Besides seeing many monkeys very close by you walk around and incredible forest with two temples.
Adults and children enjoy the park!"
